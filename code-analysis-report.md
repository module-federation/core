Found 15 high-level directory suggestions:
Dir Suggestion 1: Between 'module' and 'plugins' - [object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]
Dir Suggestion 2: Between 'module' and 'remote' - 1. Replace verbose object property assignments with shorthand where possible. For example, change `{ remoteInfo: remoteInfo }` to `{ remoteInfo }`. 2. Simplify conditional checks and assignments. For instance, `const { loadFactory = true } = options || { loadFactory: true };` can be shortened to `const { loadFactory = true } = options ?? {};`. 3. Use optional chaining and nullish coalescing to reduce verbose checks. For example, `remoteInfo?.shareScope || 'default'` instead of `this.remoteInfo.shareScope || 'default'`. 4. Consolidate similar error handling patterns into more concise forms. For example, use a single error handling function that can be reused across different try-catch blocks. 5. Remove redundant type annotations where TypeScript can infer them, such as in simple property assignments within constructors.
Dir Suggestion 3: Between 'module' and 'shared' - 1. Replace verbose object property assignments with shorthand where possible. For example, change `{ remoteInfo: remoteInfo, host: host }` to `{ remoteInfo, host }`.
2. Consolidate repeated type assertions and checks. For instance, multiple instances of `remoteEntryExports as RemoteEntryExports` could be minimized by ensuring the type is correctly inferred or asserted once.
3. Simplify conditional assignments. For example, `const { loadFactory = true } = options || { loadFactory: true };` can be shortened to `const { loadFactory = true } = options ?? {};`.
4. Use optional chaining to reduce verbose null checks. For example, `if (remoteEntryExports?.init === 'undefined')` can be simplified to `if (!remoteEntryExports?.init)`.
5. Reduce redundancy in error handling and assertions by consolidating similar checks or using helper functions more effectively.
6. Simplify the `wraperFactory` method by combining the Promise and non-Promise paths where possible, reducing duplicate code.
Dir Suggestion 4: Between 'module' and 'type' - 1. In the 'Module' class, the constructor parameter destructuring can be simplified by directly assigning the parameters to the class properties without an intermediate object. Before: `constructor({ remoteInfo, host }: { remoteInfo: RemoteInfo; host: FederationHost; }) { this.remoteInfo = remoteInfo; this.host = host; }` After: `constructor(public remoteInfo: RemoteInfo, public host: FederationHost) {}` 2. The 'wraperFactory' method's conditional can be simplified using a ternary operator. Before: `if (moduleFactory instanceof Promise) { return async () => { const res = await moduleFactory(); defineModuleId(res, id); return res; }; } else { return () => { const res = moduleFactory(); defineModuleId(res, id); return res; }; }` After: `return moduleFactory instanceof Promise ? async () => { const res = await moduleFactory(); defineModuleId(res, id); return res; } : () => { const res = moduleFactory(); defineModuleId(res, id); return res; };` 3. The 'get' method's options parameter destructuring can be simplified. Before: `const { loadFactory = true } = options || { loadFactory: true };` After: `const { loadFactory = true } = options ?? {};` 4. In type definitions, repeated type aliases like 'CoreLifeCyclePartial', 'SnapshotLifeCycleCyclePartial', etc., could be consolidated into a single generic type to reduce redundancy. Before: Multiple type aliases for each lifecycle. After: A single generic type like `type LifeCyclePartial<T> = Partial<{ [k in keyof T]: Parameters<T[k]['on']>[0]; }>;` and then use it as `CoreLifeCyclePartial = LifeCyclePartial<CoreLifeCycle>;`, etc.
Dir Suggestion 5: Between 'module' and 'utils' - 1. In the 'Module' class, the constructor parameter destructuring can be simplified by directly assigning parameters to class properties. Before: `constructor({ remoteInfo, host }: { remoteInfo: RemoteInfo; host: FederationHost; }) { this.remoteInfo = remoteInfo; this.host = host; }` After: `constructor({ remoteInfo, host }: { remoteInfo: RemoteInfo; host: FederationHost; }) { Object.assign(this, { remoteInfo, host }); }` 2. The 'get' method's options parameter default value can be simplified. Before: `const { loadFactory = true } = options || { loadFactory: true };` After: `const { loadFactory = true } = options ?? {};` 3. The 'wraperFactory' method's conditional can be simplified using a ternary. Before: `if (moduleFactory instanceof Promise) { return async () => { const res = await moduleFactory(); defineModuleId(res, id); return res; }; } else { return () => { const res = moduleFactory(); defineModuleId(res, id); return res; }; }` After: `return moduleFactory instanceof Promise ? async () => { const res = await moduleFactory(); defineModuleId(res, id); return res; } : () => { const res = moduleFactory(); defineModuleId(res, id); return res; };` 4. In 'utils', the 'addUniqueItem' function can be simplified.

The 'isRemoteInfoWithEntry' function can be simplified. Before: `return typeof (remote as RemoteWithEntry).entry !== 'undefined';` After: `return 'entry' in remote;`
Dir Suggestion 6: Between 'plugins' and 'remote' - [object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]
Dir Suggestion 7: Between 'plugins' and 'shared' - 1. Replace verbose conditional checks with ternary operators where applicable. For example, change 'if (activeVersion) { ... } else { ... }' to 'activeVersion ? ... : ...'. 2. Use shorthand property names in object literals when the property name and variable name are the same. For instance, change '{ name: name, version: version }' to '{ name, version }'. 3. Simplify arrow functions with implicit returns when the function body consists of a single statement. For example, change '() => { return document.querySelector(...); }' to '() => document.querySelector(...)'. 4. Consolidate repeated object property assignments into a single spread operation when possible. For example, instead of assigning properties one by one, use '...shared' to include all properties at once. 5. Use default parameters to eliminate redundant checks for undefined values. For instance, replace 'function (param) { param = param || defaultValue; }' with 'function (param = defaultValue) { }'.
Dir Suggestion 8: Between 'plugins' and 'type' - [object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]
Dir Suggestion 9: Between 'plugins' and 'utils' - 1. Replace verbose conditional checks with ternary operators where applicable. For example, in 'getFMId' function, the conditional could be simplified to: return `${remoteInfo.name}${'version' in remoteInfo && remoteInfo.version ? ':' + remoteInfo.version : ''}`;
2. In 'isRemoteInfoWithEntry' and 'isPureRemoteEntry', the type checks can be simplified using optional chaining and nullish coalescing. For example, 'isRemoteInfoWithEntry' could be: return (remote as RemoteWithEntry)?.entry !== undefined;
3. The 'safeWrapper' function's disableWarn parameter can be simplified by directly using the logical OR operator for the default value. For example, !disableWarn || warn(e);
4. The 'isObject' and 'isPlainObject' functions can be combined into a single utility function if their usage contexts allow, reducing redundancy.
5. In 'arrayOptions', the function can be simplified to a one-liner: return Array.isArray(options) ? options : [options];
6. The 'splitId' function's conditional logic can be simplified using array destructuring and default values. For example: const [name, version] = id.split(':'); return { name, version };
7. The 'normalizePreloadExposes' function can be simplified using a ternary operator for the expose check and replace. For example: return exposes?.map(expose => expose === '.' ? expose : expose.startsWith('./') ? expose.replace('./', '') : expose) || [];
8. The 'defaultPreloadArgs' function can be simplified by directly spreading the preloadConfig into the returned object without the 'as PreloadConfig' type assertion if TypeScript's type inference is sufficient.
9. The 'assignRemoteInfo' function's entryUrl assignment can be simplified using a ternary operator for the protocol check. For example: entryUrl = !isBrowserEnv() && !entryUrl.startsWith('http') ? `https:${entryUrl}` : entryUrl;
Dir Suggestion 10: Between 'remote' and 'shared' - 1. Replace verbose object property assignments with shorthand where possible. For example, change `{ loadFactory: loadFactory }` to `{ loadFactory }`.
2. Consolidate repeated error handling patterns into a single utility pattern, though without creating new functions as per constraints.
3. Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) to simplify null checks and default assignments. For example, replace `options && options.loadFactory` with `options?.loadFactory`.
4. Simplify conditional assignments using logical operators. For example, replace `if (!remote.type) { remote.type = DEFAULT_REMOTE_TYPE; }` with `remote.type = remote.type || DEFAULT_REMOTE_TYPE;`.
5. Use destructuring in function parameters to reduce verbosity. For example, replace `function({ pkgName, shared, from, lib, loading, loaded, get })` with more concise parameter names where clarity is not compromised.
6. Reduce redundancy in hook emissions by standardizing parameter passing patterns where possible, though without restructuring the codebase.
7. Use template literals for string concatenation to improve readability and reduce size where applicable.
8. Simplify array checks and operations using modern JavaScript features like `Array.includes()` or `Array.find()` where applicable.
Dir Suggestion 11: Between 'remote' and 'type' - 1. Replace verbose object property assignments with shorthand where possible. For example, change `{ loadFactory: loadFactory }` to `{ loadFactory }`.
2. Use optional chaining to simplify null checks. For example, replace `options && options.force` with `options?.force`.
3. Consolidate similar type definitions to reduce redundancy. For example, `RemoteInfoOptionalVersion` and `RemoteInfo` share many properties and could be merged or extended.
4. Use template literals for string concatenation to improve readability and reduce size. For example, replace `'The alias ' + remote.alias + ' of remote ' + remote.name` with ``The alias ${remote.alias} of remote ${remote.name}``.
5. Simplify conditional assignments using logical operators. For example, replace `if (!remote.shareScope) { remote.shareScope = DEFAULT_SCOPE; }` with `remote.shareScope ||= DEFAULT_SCOPE;`.
6. Use destructuring in function parameters to reduce verbosity. For example, replace `function(remote, targetRemotes, options)` with `function({ remote, targetRemotes, options })` where applicable.
7. Remove redundant type annotations where TypeScript can infer them. For example, in `const module: Module | undefined = host.moduleCache.get(remote.name);`, the type annotation can be omitted if the return type of `get` is correctly typed.
Dir Suggestion 12: Between 'remote' and 'utils' - 1. Replace verbose object property assignments with shorthand where possible. For example, change `{ loadFactory: loadFactory }` to `{ loadFactory }`.
2. Use ternary operators for simple conditional assignments to reduce lines. For instance, `let moduleName; if (name.endsWith('/')) { moduleName = name.slice(0, -1); } else { moduleName = name; }` can be `let moduleName = name.endsWith('/') ? name.slice(0, -1) : name;`.
3. Simplify arrow functions with implicit returns when the function body is a single expression. For example, `() => { return something; }` can be `() => something`.
4. Consolidate repeated default parameter assignments. For instance, multiple instances of `options || { from: 'runtime' }` can be standardized if they serve the same purpose.
5. Use template literals for string concatenation to improve readability and reduce concatenation operators. For example, `'Version ' + maxOrSingletonVersion + ' from ' + maxOrSingletonVersion` can be ``Version ${maxOrSingletonVersion} from ${maxOrSingletonVersion}``.
6. Remove redundant type assertions and annotations where TypeScript can infer the types correctly, reducing verbosity without losing type safety.
Dir Suggestion 13: Between 'shared' and 'type' - 1. Replace verbose interface declarations with type aliases where possible. For example, 'export interface PreloadRemoteArgs' could be 'export type PreloadRemoteArgs = {...}'. 2. Consolidate similar type definitions. For instance, 'RemoteInfoOptionalVersion' and 'RemoteInfo' share many properties and could potentially be merged or extended. 3. Use shorthand property names in object literals. For example, 'return { shareInfos, shared };' could be 'return { shareInfos, shared };' if the property names and variable names are the same. 4. Remove redundant type annotations when TypeScript can infer them. For example, 'const promises: Promise<any>[] = [];' could be 'const promises = [];' since TypeScript can infer the array type. 5. Use optional chaining and nullish coalescing to simplify null checks. For example, 'if (!initToken) initToken = initTokens[shareScopeName] = { from: this.host.name };' could be 'initToken ??= initTokens[shareScopeName] = { from: this.host.name };'.
Dir Suggestion 14: Between 'shared' and 'utils' - 1. Replace verbose arrow functions with concise ones where possible. For example, change `(prev: string, cur: string): boolean => { return versionLt(prev, cur); }` to `(prev: string, cur: string): boolean => versionLt(prev, cur)`. 2. Use ternary operators for simple conditional assignments. For instance, `if (name.endsWith('/')) { moduleName = name.slice(0, -1); } else { moduleName = name; }` can be shortened to `moduleName = name.endsWith('/') ? name.slice(0, -1) : name;`. 3. Simplify object property assignments when the property name and variable name are the same. For example, `return { name: splitInfo[0], version: splitInfo[1] };` can be written as `return { name: splitInfo[0], version: splitInfo[1] };` if the variables are already named 'name' and 'version'. 4. Consolidate repeated logic in conditional checks. For example, the repeated checks for `isLoadingOrLoaded` in `findSingletonVersionOrderByLoaded` could be refactored into a single helper variable or function call within the method to reduce duplication.
Dir Suggestion 15: Between 'type' and 'utils' - 1. Replace verbose type definitions with more concise alternatives. For example, change `export type Optional<T, K extends keyof T> = Omit<T, K> & Partial<T>;` to `export type Optional<T, K extends keyof T> = Pick<Partial<T>, K> & Omit<T, K>;` for a more concise definition. 2. Simplify repeated array checks and operations. For instance, `export function addUniqueItem(arr: Array<string>, item: string): Array<string> { if (arr.findIndex((name) => name === item) === -1) { arr.push(item); } return arr; }` can be shortened to `export function addUniqueItem(arr: Array<string>, item: string): Array<string> { return arr.includes(item) ? arr : [...arr, item]; }`. 3. Use ternary operators more extensively for conditional assignments to reduce lines. For example, in `export function getFMId(remoteInfo: RemoteInfoOptionalVersion | RemoteWithEntry): string { if ('version' in remoteInfo && remoteInfo.version) { return `${remoteInfo.name}:${remoteInfo.version}`; } else if ('entry' in remoteInfo && remoteInfo.entry) { return `${remoteInfo.name}:${remoteInfo.entry}`; } else { return `${remoteInfo.name}`; } }`, replace with `export function getFMId(remoteInfo: RemoteInfoOptionalVersion | RemoteWithEntry): string { return 'version' in remoteInfo && remoteInfo.version ? `${remoteInfo.name}:${remoteInfo.version}` : 'entry' in remoteInfo && remoteInfo.entry ? `${remoteInfo.name}:${remoteInfo.entry}` : `${remoteInfo.name}`; }`. 4. Consolidate similar utility functions. For example, `isObject` and `isPlainObject` could be combined with a parameter to differentiate behavior, reducing the overall function count.

The 'wraperFactory' method's conditional can be simplified using a ternary operator. Before: `if (moduleFactory instanceof Promise) { return async () => { const res = await moduleFactory(); defineModuleId(res, id); return res; }; } else { return () => { const res = moduleFactory(); defineModuleId(res, id); return res; }; }` After: `return moduleFactory instanceof Promise ? async () => { const res = await moduleFactory(); defineModuleId(res, id); return res; } : () => { const res = moduleFactory(); defineModuleId(res, id); return res; };` 3. The 'get' method's options parameter destructuring can be simplified. Before: `const { loadFactory = true } = options || { loadFactory: true };` After: `const { loadFactory = true } = options ?? {};` 4. In type definitions, repeated type aliases like 'CoreLifeCyclePartial', 'SnapshotLifeCycleCyclePartial', etc., could be consolidated into a single generic type to reduce redundancy. Before: Multiple type aliases for each lifecycle. After: A single generic type like `type LifeCyclePartial<T> = Partial<{ [k in keyof T]: Parameters<T[k]['on']>[0]; }>;` and then use it as `CoreLifeCyclePartial = LifeCyclePartial<CoreLifeCycle>;`, etc.

4. The 'isObject' and 'isPlainObject' functions can be combined into a single utility function if their usage contexts allow, reducing redundancy.
5. In 'arrayOptions', the function can be simplified to a one-liner: return Array.isArray(options) ? options : [options];
6. The 'splitId' function's conditional logic can be simplified using array destructuring and default values. For example: const [name, version] = id.split(':'); return { name, version };
7. The 'normalizePreloadExposes' function can be simplified using a ternary operator for the expose check and replace. For example: return exposes?.map(expose => expose === '.' ? expose : expose.startsWith('./') ? expose.replace('./', '') : expose) || [];
8. The 'defaultPreloadArgs' function can be simplified by directly spreading the preloadConfig into the returned object without the 'as PreloadConfig' type assertion if TypeScript's type inference is sufficient.
9. The 'assignRemoteInfo' function's entryUrl assignment can be simplified using a ternary operator for the protocol check. For example: entryUrl = !isBrowserEnv() && !entryUrl.startsWith('http') ? `https:${entryUrl}` : entryUrl;

### Directory Suggestion 12

**Directories:** `remote` and `utils`

**Description:** Several opportunities for code size reduction through syntax simplification and pattern consolidation were identified.

**Suggestion:** 1. Replace verbose object property assignments with shorthand where possible. For example, change `{ loadFactory: loadFactory }` to `{ loadFactory }`.
2. Use ternary operators for simple conditional assignments to reduce lines. For instance, `let moduleName; if (name.endsWith('/')) { moduleName = name.slice(0, -1); } else { moduleName = name; }` can be `let moduleName = name.endsWith('/') ? name.slice(0, -1) : name;`.
3. Simplify arrow functions with implicit returns when the function body is a single expression. For example, `() => { return something; }` can be `() => something`.
4. Consolidate repeated default parameter assignments. For instance, multiple instances of `options || { from: 'runtime' }` can be standardized if they serve the same purpose.
5. Use template literals for string concatenation to improve readability and reduce concatenation operators. For example, `'Version ' + maxOrSingletonVersion + ' from ' + maxOrSingletonVersion` can be ``Version ${maxOrSingletonVersion} from ${maxOrSingletonVersion}``.
6. Remove redundant type assertions and annotations where TypeScript can infer the types correctly, reducing verbosity without losing type safety.

### Directory Suggestion 13

**Directories:** `shared` and `type`

**Description:** Several opportunities for code size reduction through syntax simplification and pattern consolidation were identified.

**Suggestion:** 1. Replace verbose interface declarations with type aliases where possible. For example, 'export interface PreloadRemoteArgs' could be 'export type PreloadRemoteArgs = {...}'. 2. Consolidate similar type definitions. For instance, 'RemoteInfoOptionalVersion' and 'RemoteInfo' share many properties and could potentially be merged or extended. 3. Use shorthand property names in object literals. For example, 'return { shareInfos, shared };' could be 'return { shareInfos, shared };' if the property names and variable names are the same. 4. Remove redundant type annotations when TypeScript can infer them. For example, 'const promises: Promise<any>[] = [];' could be 'const promises = [];' since TypeScript can infer the array type. 5. Use optional chaining and nullish coalescing to simplify null checks. For example, 'if (!initToken) initToken = initTokens[shareScopeName] = { from: this.host.name };' could be 'initToken ??= initTokens[shareScopeName] = { from: this.host.name };'.

### Directory Suggestion 14

**Directories:** `shared` and `utils`

**Description:** Several opportunities for code size reduction through syntax simplification and pattern consolidation were identified.

**Suggestion:** 1. Replace verbose arrow functions with concise ones where possible. For example, change `(prev: string, cur: string): boolean => { return versionLt(prev, cur); }` to `(prev: string, cur: string): boolean => versionLt(prev, cur)`. 2. Use ternary operators for simple conditional assignments. For instance, `if (name.endsWith('/')) { moduleName = name.slice(0, -1); } else { moduleName = name; }` can be shortened to `moduleName = name.endsWith('/') ? name.slice(0, -1) : name;`. 3. Simplify object property assignments when the property name and variable name are the same. For example, `return { name: splitInfo[0], version: splitInfo[1] };` can be written as `return { name: splitInfo[0], version: splitInfo[1] };` if the variables are already named 'name' and 'version'. 4. Consolidate repeated logic in conditional checks. For example, the repeated checks for `isLoadingOrLoaded` in `findSingletonVersionOrderByLoaded` could be refactored into a single helper variable or function call within the method to reduce duplication.

---

### Directory Suggestion 15

**Directories:** `type` and `utils`

**Description:** Several opportunities for code size reduction through syntax simplification and pattern consolidation were identified.

**Suggestion:** 1. Replace verbose type definitions with more concise alternatives. For example, change `export type Optional<T, K extends keyof T> = Omit<T, K> & Partial<T>;` to `export type Optional<T, K extends keyof T> = Pick<Partial<T>, K> & Omit<T, K>;` for a more concise definition. 2. Simplify repeated array checks and operations. For instance, `export function addUniqueItem(arr: Array<string>, item: string): Array<string> { if (arr.findIndex((name) => name === item) === -1) { arr.push(item); } return arr; }` can be shortened to `export function addUniqueItem(arr: Array<string>, item: string): Array<string> { return arr.includes(item) ? arr : [...arr, item]; }`. 3. Use ternary operators more extensively for conditional assignments to reduce lines. For example, in `export function getFMId(remoteInfo: RemoteInfoOptionalVersion | RemoteWithEntry): string { if ('version' in remoteInfo && remoteInfo.version) { return `${remoteInfo.name}:${remoteInfo.version}`; } else if ('entry' in remoteInfo && remoteInfo.entry) { return `${remoteInfo.name}:${remoteInfo.entry}`; } else { return `${remoteInfo.name}`; } }`, replace with `export function getFMId(remoteInfo: RemoteInfoOptionalVersion | RemoteWithEntry): string { return 'version' in remoteInfo && remoteInfo.version ? `${remoteInfo.name}:${remoteInfo.version}` : 'entry' in remoteInfo && remoteInfo.entry ? `${remoteInfo.name}:${remoteInfo.entry}` : `${remoteInfo.name}`; }`. 4. Consolidate similar utility functions. For example, `isObject` and `isPlainObject` could be combined with a parameter to differentiate behavior, reducing the overall function count.
