## Setup Development Environment

### Install Node.js

We recommend using Node.js 18 LTS. Check your Node.js version with `node -v`.

To install Node.js, use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm):

```bash
# Install Node.js 18 LTS
nvm install 18 --lts
nvm alias default 18
nvm use 18
```

### Install Dependencies

```sh
# Enable pnpm with corepack, only available on Node.js >= `v14.19.0`
corepack enable
```

Add nx to global

```bash
pnpm add nx@latest -g
```

First, install NX globally:

```sh
pnpm install
```

What this will do:

- Install all dependencies
- Create symlinks between packages in the monorepo


## Testing

Testing is a crucial part of the development process in Module Federation. Here's how you can run tests:

### Running All Tests

To execute all test suites in the project, use:

```sh
npx nx run-many -t test --parallel=3
```

This command runs every test across all projects in the repository.

### Running Tests for Specific Projects

If you need to run tests for a specific project, use:

```sh
npx nx run-many -t test --parallel=3 --projects=PROJECT-NAME
```

Replace `PROJECT-NAME` with the actual name of the project you want to test. The `--parallel=3` flag allows simultaneous execution of up to 3 test suites, improving the overall testing speed.

### Running Impacted Tests

To run tests only for the projects affected by recent changes, use:

```sh
npx nx affected -t test --parallel=3 --exclude='*,!tag:type:pkg'
```

This command ensures that only relevant tests are executed, saving time and resources.


## Submitting Changes

### Add a Changeset

Universe is using [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage the versioning and changelogs.

If you've changed some packages, you need add a new changeset for the changes. Please run `changeset` command to select the changed packages and add the changeset info.

```sh
pnpm run changeset
```

### Committing your Changes

Commit your changes to your forked repo, and [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

### Format of PR titles

The format of PR titles follow Conventional Commits.

An example:

|    |    |__ Subject
|    |_______ Scope

```


## Release

Module Federation uses GitHub Actions for automated versioning and publishing:

## Release test version

1. Make sure your branch has added changeset files before releasing the test version
2. Make sure that both "use workflow from" and "release branch" are split for the test version you want to release
3. Use the "next" TAB to release the test version

## Release the official version

1. Use the release pull request to release an official version
    * It will create a pull request that includes the changed version

2. If the version is normal, release it using release workflow and then a branch of pull request
