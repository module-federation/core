## Setup Development Environment

#### Install Node.js

We recommend using the LTS version of Node.js 18. You can check your currently used Node.js version with the following command:

```bash
node -v
#v18.18.2
```

If you do not have Node.js installed in your current environment, you can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) to install it.

Here is an example of how to install the Node.js 18 LTS version via nvm:

```bash
# Install the LTS version of Node.js 18
nvm install 18 --lts

# Make the newly installed Node.js 18 as the default version
nvm alias default 18

# Switch to the newly installed Node.js 18
nvm use 18
```

#### Install Dependencies

Install NX

```bash
npm install --global nx@latest
```

Install Node.js dependencies via npm.

```bash
npm install
```

## Testing

You can run all test cases by the follow command: 
```sh
npm run test
```

You can also run specific project test cases by the follow command:
```sh
nx test PROJECT_NAME
```

## Release

To make releasing easier, Module Federation use github action to automate creating versioning pull requests, and optionally publishing packages.

### version release

- to release a version, please follow this command:
  - `nx run PROJECT-NAME:version --releaseAs=MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH`
    - find more options [here](https://github.com/jscutlery/semver#specify-the-level-of-change)
- this command will perform couple of operations.
  - tag your commit with the relevant version.
  - create changelog using semantic commits.
  - bump the version of the project.
  - if other projects depends on the current released project, they will be bumped as well.
  - if case of bumping nextjs-mf project, NPM publish operation will be performed as well.
