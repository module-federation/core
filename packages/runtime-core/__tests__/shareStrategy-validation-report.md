# shareStrategy Offline Behavior Documentation Validation Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents the validation of shareStrategy offline behavior claims in the Module Federation documentation. Through code analysis, implementation review, and comprehensive testing, we have verified the accuracy of most claims while identifying and correcting several inaccuracies.

## Key Findings

### ✅ VERIFIED - Core Behavior Claims

1. **Version-First Strategy Behavior**
   - ✅ Loads all remote entry files during initialization
   - ✅ Ensures highest version of shared dependencies is used
   - ✅ Causes application startup failures if any remote is offline
   - ✅ Implemented via `findSingletonVersionOrderByVersion` function

2. **Loaded-First Strategy Behavior**
   - ✅ Loads remotes on-demand rather than during initialization
   - ✅ Prioritizes reuse of already loaded shared dependencies
   - ✅ Handles offline remotes gracefully (fails only when accessing specific remotes)
   - ✅ Implemented via `findSingletonVersionOrderByLoaded` function

3. **Performance Characteristics**
   - ✅ Version-first has slower initialization (loads all remotes upfront)
   - ✅ Loaded-first has faster initialization (deferred loading)
   - ✅ Trade-off between initialization speed and runtime resolution guarantees

### 🔧 CORRECTED - Documentation Inaccuracies

1. **Default Value Clarification**
   - **Issue**: Documentation claimed runtime core defaults to 'version-first'
   - **Reality**: Runtime core leaves shareStrategy undefined; default is set by webpack plugin/bundler runtime
   - **Fix**: Updated documentation to clarify "Default: 'version-first' (set by webpack plugin/bundler runtime)"

2. **Contradictory Troubleshooting Information**
   - **Issue**: RUNTIME-003.mdx incorrectly stated both strategies trigger manifest loading during initialization
   - **Reality**: Only version-first triggers manifest loading during initialization
   - **Fix**: Corrected troubleshooting documentation to accurately describe each strategy's behavior

3. **Enhanced Warning Section**
   - **Added**: More detailed guidance for production applications
   - **Added**: Specific recommendations for offline resilience
   - **Added**: Clear distinction between strategy behaviors regarding offline remotes

### 🔍 Technical Implementation Details

#### Code Locations Validated
- `packages/runtime-core/src/utils/share.ts` - Core strategy implementation
- `packages/webpack-bundler-runtime/src/remotes.ts` - Version-first integration
- `packages/enhanced/src/lib/container/runtime/utils.ts` - Default setting
- `packages/enhanced/test/configCases/sharing/shared-strategy/` - Existing tests

#### Strategy Implementation Logic
```typescript
// Version-first: Prioritizes highest version
function findSingletonVersionOrderByVersion(shareScopeMap, scope, pkgName) {
  const callback = (prev, cur) => !isLoaded(versions[prev]) && versionLt(prev, cur);
  return findVersion(shareScopeMap[scope][pkgName], callback);
}

// Loaded-first: Prioritizes already loaded versions
function findSingletonVersionOrderByLoaded(shareScopeMap, scope, pkgName) {
  const callback = (prev, cur) => {
    if (isLoadingOrLoaded(versions[cur])) {
      return isLoadingOrLoaded(versions[prev]) ? versionLt(prev, cur) : true;
    }
    return isLoadingOrLoaded(versions[prev]) ? false : versionLt(prev, cur);
  };
  return findVersion(shareScopeMap[scope][pkgName], callback);
}
```

## Recommendations

### For Users
1. **Production Applications**: Consider `loaded-first` strategy for better offline resilience
2. **Strict Version Requirements**: Use `version-first` with proper error handling
3. **Network-Constrained Environments**: Implement retry mechanisms and fallback strategies

### For Developers
1. **Error Handling**: Always implement `errorLoadRemote` hooks when using `version-first`
2. **Testing**: Test offline scenarios during development
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor remote availability in production

### For Documentation Maintainers
1. **Consistency**: Ensure all documentation references shareStrategy behavior consistently
2. **Examples**: Add more real-world examples of offline handling
3. **Integration**: Better cross-reference between configuration and troubleshooting docs

## Conclusion

The shareStrategy offline behavior documentation was largely accurate in its core claims but contained several inaccuracies that could mislead users. All identified issues have been corrected, and comprehensive test coverage has been added to prevent future regressions. The enhanced documentation now provides clearer guidance for production usage and offline resilience.

The investigation confirms that:
- ✅ `version-first` strategy does load all remotes during initialization
- ✅ `loaded-first` strategy does defer loading until needed
- ✅ Offline remotes behave differently under each strategy as documented
- ✅ The warning about startup failures with `version-first` is accurate
- ✅ The implementation matches the documented behavior

All tests pass and the documentation updates provide users with more accurate and actionable guidance for handling offline remote scenarios.
