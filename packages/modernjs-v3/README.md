# @module-federation/modern-js-v3

This plugin integrates Module Federation with Modern.js. See the [Modern.js integration documentation](https://module-federation.io/guide/framework/modernjs.html) for general configuration.

## Independent Bridge application SSR

Bridge applications can render in the host's Node process while keeping their own React root, React version, router, and Modern runtime. The host forwards complete HTML fragments as they become available; it does not wait for the entire remote application to become a string. The browser hydrates each application with its own renderer after its stream, loader snapshot, and pending React boundaries have completed.

This integration requires the Modern application APIs `@modern-js/runtime/application` and `@modern-js/runtime/application/server`, plus request context, `shellEndMarker`, and `identifierPrefix` support in Modern's streaming SSR extension. Use a Modern build that includes these APIs; installing this MF plugin alone does not add them to older Modern releases. Generated entries use the producer's actual Modern route tree and loaders through `createApplication` and `renderApplication`.

Configure a host in `modern.config.ts`:

```ts
import { appTools, defineConfig } from '@modern-js/app-tools';
import { moduleFederationPlugin } from '@module-federation/modern-js-v3';

export default defineConfig({
  server: { ssr: { mode: 'stream', forceCSR: true } },
  plugins: [
    appTools(),
    moduleFederationPlugin({
      bridge: true,
      config: {
        name: 'commerce_host',
        remotes: {
          products: 'commerce_products@https://assets.example.com/products/mf-manifest.json',
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

Configure a producer application in its own `modern.config.ts`:

```ts
import { appTools, defineConfig } from '@modern-js/app-tools';
import { moduleFederationPlugin } from '@module-federation/modern-js-v3';

export default defineConfig({
  server: { ssr: { mode: 'stream', forceCSR: true } },
  output: { assetPrefix: 'https://assets.example.com/products/' },
  plugins: [
    appTools(),
    moduleFederationPlugin({
      bridge: { exposes: { './App': true } },
      config: { name: 'commerce_products' },
    }),
  ],
});
```

`true` selects the main Modern application entry. For a named entry, use `bridge: { exposes: { './App': 'entryName' } }`. The entry must use Modern's automatic application mounting. Expose names must start with `./` and must not duplicate `config.exposes`. To change the default 30-second SSR deadline, use `bridge: { timeoutMs: 10000 }` on the host.

Consume the application in a host component:

```tsx
import { createRemoteAppComponent } from '@module-federation/modern-js-v3/react';
import { loadRemote } from '@module-federation/modern-js-v3/runtime';

const Products = createRemoteAppComponent({
  loader: () => loadRemote('products/App'),
  loading: <p>Loading products…</p>,
  fallback: () => <p>Products could not be loaded.</p>,
});

export default function Dashboard() {
  return <Products memoryRoute={{ entryPath: '/' }} />;
}
```

`memoryRoute` selects the producer's initial route independently of the host URL. Pass JSON-serializable business props when they must participate in SSR. Each rendered instance receives a separate root, snapshot, and React identifier prefix, including multiple instances of the same producer.

### Producer stylesheets

Bridge SSR collects CSS automatically from the loaded MF manifest for the exposed application. It includes the matching expose's synchronous and asynchronous CSS assets so that lazy routes have styles available. This is a conservative set for the expose, not a precise list of assets used by the current route. No additional demo or application configuration is required.

Stylesheet URLs known before the host head is emitted become ordinary `<link rel="stylesheet">` elements in that head. This follows the usual SSR stylesheet strategy: these links block the initial paint and can delay execution of the inline Bridge bootstrap that follows them. A slow stylesheet on this path can therefore delay the host and other remotes as well.

With a cold or lazy remote load, asset discovery may finish after the head has already streamed. Those URLs travel in the remote's `meta.stylesheets` frame; the browser immediately creates or reuses matching stylesheet links in the document head. On this late-metadata path, the browser retains each dependent remote's loading content until its stylesheets have loaded, then inserts its queued SSR fragments. This per-instance gate does not wait on stylesheets for unrelated remotes or hold up the host. The integration does not guarantee that every remote stylesheet appears in the initial head.

URLs are deduplicated, and existing applicable stylesheet links are reused. Once the Bridge bootstrap starts, CSS load failures and expiry of its existing SSR watchdog follow the whole-page CSR fallback policy described below. That watchdog cannot impose a timeout on the earlier native stylesheet blocking period before the bootstrap executes.

The generated MF runtime plugin uses the same Bridge ESM entry as the application components, keeping manifest asset collection on the initialized runtime instance. Standard Bridge CJS/ESM plugin entries are normalized and deduplicated while preserving plugin options; custom runtime plugins are unchanged.

## Server and browser lifecycle selection

`bridge: true` (or `bridge.exposes` on a producer) also installs `BridgeSSRPlugin` from `@module-federation/modern-js-v3/rspack`. In a Node Rspack compilation it resolves the internal `@module-federation/bridge-react/remote-lifecycle` import to its `.server` entry. Browser compilations retain the default lifecycle. This substitution is limited to the Bridge boundary; it does not change extension resolution for application files or other dependencies. Normal package import/require resolution is retained so the selected lifecycle uses the same Bridge package copy and module format as its caller.

Bridge publishes both lifecycle modules and keeps their import boundary external in its library build. Merely naming a source file `.server.ts` would not make that file selectable after bundling.

The component factories and `RemoteAppWrapper` keep one shared implementation of instance IDs, Suspense boundaries, refs, and container JSX. The server lifecycle registers SSR work and styles. The browser lifecycle handles mount/update/destroy and delegates stream claiming and hydration to its browser hydration helper. Generic Bridge CSR remains usable without Modern or this Rspack plugin. SSR hydration still runs in the browser; only Node registration is selected by the server build.

## Deployment and failure behavior

Publish the producer's MF manifest, browser assets, and Node SSR entry with all its referenced chunks. The host uses the existing MF Node loader to load and execute that Node build in its own process. A producer SSR HTTP service or an additional per-producer server is not required. Static artifact delivery may still use HTTP; this is separate from calling an HTTP rendering service.

The default path is SSR. Loading, rendering, stream completion, and hydration failures trigger a single whole-page navigation that sets `csr=1` and preserves other query parameters and the URL hash. Enable Modern's `server.ssr.forceCSR` on the host so that the next request selects CSR; this plugin does not change that Modern setting automatically. In CSR mode, the browser mounts the producer applications through their normal browser entries. A missing browser artifact can still fail and is shown by the component's error fallback.

A received stream is not proof of success: the protocol must reach its final snapshot and completion frame, and deferred React boundary insertion must finish. Truncated or stalled streams fall back after the deadline. Once a partial SSR response has been delivered, failure uses the same whole-page CSR navigation.

## Current limits

- Use distinct MF names for the host and producers. Do not share React, ReactDOM, React Router, or the Modern runtime between these applications; the Bridge configuration rejects those shared entries.
- The current adapter executes Node builds locally. HTTP SSR transport and an HTTP-to-local rendering retry chain are not implemented.
- Streaming completion script isolation has regression coverage with React 18.3.1 and React 19.2.8. It relies on React's internal streaming instructions, so other renderer versions need compatibility validation. The adapter recognizes React instruction shapes; it is not a sandbox for arbitrary JavaScript. React Form Actions' document-wide replay protocol is not supported by this isolation mechanism.
- Remote stream script replay supports inline classic scripts and forwards the SSR CSP nonce. External or module scripts inside the remote HTML stream are not supported; browser bundles load through Module Federation.

## Planned React compatibility matrix

This is a test requirement recorded on 2026-09-28, not completed coverage or a broader support claim. The current real-renderer regressions cover React 18.3.1 and 19.2.8 only.

- React 19: cover every stable release, including patch releases, rather than only the latest version of each minor. Canary, experimental, alpha, beta, and RC releases are outside this initial matrix.
- React 18: cover most stable releases, including every minor line and broad patch coverage. When implementing the matrix, check in the exact version list and document any omissions and their reasons; one latest-only case is insufficient.
- React 17: retain only the latest stable 17.x release. Cover the generic Bridge CSR mount/update/destroy behavior separately. The current Modern independent streaming SSR path uses React 18+ APIs (`renderToPipeableStream`, `hydrateRoot`, and host `useId`); a React 17 test must not be reported as support for that same streaming path. Supporting legacy React 17 SSR would require a separately designed adapter.

Resolve `react` and `react-dom` as matching exact versions for each case and record the versions tested. Refresh the explicit matrix when stable releases are added; do not let a floating `latest` replace historical coverage. React's API transition is documented in the [React 18 upgrade guide](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide#updates-to-server-rendering-apis).

Use actual renderer output, not only handwritten `$RC` fixtures. For supported SSR cases, validate byte-boundary framing, nested and multiple Suspense boundaries, both completion orders, errors/abort/truncation, script helper isolation, DOM reuse during hydration, and post-hydration interactions. Include mixed Host/Remote versions, multiple producers, and repeated instances of the same producer; record which combinations were exercised separately from per-version coverage. Generic CSR and instance teardown must remain independently tested.

Unknown React completion instruction shapes currently pass through unchanged. The expanded matrix must expose missed or partial script isolation; a successful check on the two current demo versions is not evidence that untested versions or unsupported document-wide React protocols are safe.
