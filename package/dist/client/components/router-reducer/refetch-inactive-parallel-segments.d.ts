 * with the "default" component, but we explicitly ignore the server in this case
 * and keep the existing state for that segment. New data for inactive segments are inherently
 * not part of the server response when we patch the tree, because they were associated with a response
 * from an earlier navigation/request. For each segment, once it becomes "active", we encode the URL that provided
 * the data for it. This function traverses parallel routes looking for these markers so that it can re-fetch
 * and patch the new data into the tree.
