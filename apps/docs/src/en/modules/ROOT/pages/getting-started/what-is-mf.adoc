= What is Module Federation?

Module Federation is a concept that allows developers to share code and resources across multiple JavaScript applications, or micro-frontends. In a traditional web application, all the code for a single page is usually contained within a single codebase. This can lead to monolithic applications that are difficult to maintain and scale.

With Module Federation, code can be split into smaller, independently deployable modules that can be loaded on demand when they are needed. This allows micro-frontends to be developed and deployed independently, which reduces coordination between teams and allows for faster development cycles.

At its core, Module Federation is based on the idea of remote loading of JavaScript modules. This means that instead of having all the code for a single application loaded at once, the code can be split into smaller, independently deployable modules that can be loaded on demand when they are needed.

Module Federation is implemented using the Webpack module bundler. Webpack is a tool that allows developers to bundle JavaScript modules into a single file that can be loaded by a web browser. With Module Federation, Webpack is extended to allow modules to be loaded from other applications, rather than just from within the same application.

To use Module Federation, developers need to configure their Webpack builds to expose certain modules to other applications and to consume modules from other applications. This can be done using the `exposes` and `remotes` options in the Webpack configuration.

- The `exposes` option is used to expose certain modules from an application to other applications. This tells Webpack which modules should be available to other applications when they are loaded remotely.
- The `remotes` option is used to consume modules from other applications. This tells Webpack which modules should be loaded remotely from other applications when they are needed.

Once the Webpack configurations for each application have been set up, the applications can be deployed independently. When a user visits a page that includes multiple micro-frontends, the micro-frontends will dynamically load the code they need from other micro-frontends using the `exposes` and `remotes` options.

== Conclusion

In summary, Module Federation allows developers to share code and resources across micro-frontends, which reduces duplication and improves code maintainability. By allowing micro-frontends to be developed and deployed independently, Module Federation reduces the need for coordination between teams and allows for faster development cycles.

Having built a necessary theoretical foundation of Module Federation, let us now pivot towards the practical aspect and embark on the journey of actual implementation, exploring the possibilities Module Federation has to offer: xref:getting-started/getting-started-practical.adoc[Getting Started with Module Federation]
