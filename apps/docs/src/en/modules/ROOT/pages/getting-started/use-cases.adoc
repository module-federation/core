= Use Cases

While Module Federation has the potential to significantly improve code sharing and reduce duplication, it is important to consider the specific use cases where it may be most beneficial. In this guide, we'll explore some of the most common use cases for Module Federation, including examples of how it can be used in different scenarios.

== Use Case 1: Micro-frontend Architecture

One of the most common use cases for Module Federation is in micro-frontend architecture. This approach involves breaking down large monolithic applications into smaller, more manageable frontend modules that can be developed and deployed independently. With Module Federation, these modules can be shared between different applications, allowing for greater flexibility and modularity in application design.

For example, imagine a large e-commerce platform with multiple frontend applications for product search, shopping cart, and checkout. By using Module Federation, the platform could share common modules such as user authentication and payment processing between the different frontend applications, reducing duplication and improving collaboration between development teams.

== Use Case 2: Multi-Application Integration

Another common use case for Module Federation is in integrating multiple applications that share common functionality. With Module Federation, developers can share modules between different applications, allowing them to work together seamlessly and share data more efficiently.

For example, imagine a suite of productivity applications such as a project management tool, a team communication app, and a time-tracking tool. By using Module Federation, these applications could share common modules such as user authentication and data storage, allowing them to work together seamlessly and share data more efficiently.

== Use Case 3: Third-Party Integrations

Module Federation can also be used for integrating third-party modules and applications into an existing application. With Module Federation, developers can easily integrate modules from different sources, allowing them to incorporate external functionality into their applications without having to develop it from scratch.

For example, imagine an e-commerce platform that wants to incorporate a third-party shipping module into their application. With Module Federation, the platform could easily integrate the shipping module into their application, allowing customers to see shipping options and prices in real-time.

== Use Case 4: Shared Libraries

Finally, Module Federation can also be used for sharing libraries and other common code between different applications. With Module Federation, developers can easily share code libraries and other common functionality, reducing duplication and improving collaboration between development teams.

For example, imagine a suite of applications that all require access to a common library of UI components. With Module Federation, these applications could share the UI component library, allowing developers to make changes and improvements to the library in one place, rather than having to make the same changes across multiple applications.

== Conclusion

By carefully considering the specific needs and requirements of their applications, developers can determine whether Module Federation is the right solution for their particular use case. Whether it's micro-frontend architecture, multi-application integration, third-party integrations, or shared libraries, Module Federation can help developers to reduce duplication, improve collaboration, and increase flexibility in application design.
