TIP: Bookmark the project page for easy access in the future.

[[selecting-a-language]]
==  Selecting a Language

Once you're on the project page, you'll see a list of components and languages that are open for translation. If you're fluent in one of those languages, you're all set to contribute!

. Scroll through the list of languages displayed on the project page.
. Click on the language you wish to translate to. This will open a new page dedicated to that language's translation status and needs.

NOTE: If you don't see your language listed, it might be fully translated or not yet added. You can request its addition through community channels or the project's administrators.

[[translating-content]]
==  Translating Content

Translating content involves going through individual strings of text that need to be translated. Each string corresponds to a specific section or line in the documentation. Here's how to do it:

. On the language-specific page, you'll find a list of strings awaiting translation. Each string has its status indicated.
. Click on a string to open the translation editor.
. In the editor, you'll see the source text at the top and a text box below it where you can enter your translation.
. Type your translation into this box.

IMPORTANT: Maintain any special formatting, placeholders, or variables present in the source text. Also, look out for any context or comments provided to help you understand the string's meaning better.

[[reviewing-translations]]
==  Reviewing Translations

Even seasoned translators make mistakes, and context can sometimes be elusive. It's a good practice to review your translations for accuracy, context, and syntax.

. After entering your translation, don't rush to save it. Take a moment to read it again.
. Use the 'Previous' and 'Next' navigation buttons in the translation editor to review adjacent strings. This can help you maintain consistency and context.
. Pay attention to grammar, syntax, and idiomatic expressions to ensure the translation is natural and accurate.

[[submitting-your-translations]]
==  Submitting Your Translations

Submitting your translations is the final step in your contribution journey. Here's how:

. Once you're satisfied with the accuracy and context of your translation, click the 'Save' button in the translation editor.
. If you're not entirely confident about your translation, you can mark it as "Needs review." This allows other contributors to verify your translation.

IMPORTANT: Anonymous users can also submit translations. These will be flagged for review by registered users or project administrators.

[[monitoring-your-contributions]]
==  Monitoring Your Contributions

If you've created a Weblate account, you can keep an eye on the status of your contributions easily.

. Go to your Weblate dashboard by clicking on your profile picture in the top-right corner.
. Navigate to the "Contributions" tab. Here you'll see a list of all your submitted translations, their current status, and any ongoing discussions or reviews related to them.

NOTE: If you contributed anonymously, you won't be able to track your contributions in this manner.
