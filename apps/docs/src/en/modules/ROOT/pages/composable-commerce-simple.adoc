= Composable Commerce with Module Federation

Composable Commerce is a new approach to building e-commerce applications that allows you to customize and extend every aspect of your online store. With Composable Commerce, you can leverage best-of-breed solutions from different vendors and combine them into a unified shopping experience for your customers.

In this guide, you will learn how to use Composable Commerce and Module Federation to create a modular and scalable e-commerce application. You will learn see how to:

- Figure out Composable Commerce concept;
- Benefits of Composable Commerce to e-commerce;
- Define the architecture and components of your application;
- Configure Webpack to enable Module Federation;
- Expose and consume modules from different bundles;
- Implement common e-commerce features such as product catalog, cart, checkout, and payment using Module Federation;

== What is Composable Commerce?

Composable commerce is an approach to e-commerce development that follows the principles of microservices, domain-driven design and API-first design. It breaks down the monolithic e-commerce application into smaller, loosely coupled components that can be composed together to create a customized and adaptable user experience. Each component is responsible for a specific business domain or functionality, such as product catalog, shopping cart, checkout, payment, etc. These components communicate with each other through well-defined APIs and events.

Composable commerce enables you to:

- Choose the best components for your business needs from different vendors or develop your own.
- Mix and match components from different sources and technologies without worrying about compatibility or integration issues.
- Replace or upgrade components without affecting the rest of the application or requiring downtime.
- Experiment with new features or functionalities without risking the stability of the application.
- Scale each component independently according to the demand and traffic.

For example, suppose you have an e-commerce application that sells books online. You can use composable commerce to create your application from different components such as:

- A product catalog component that provides the data and UI for browsing and searching books by title, author, genre, etc.
- A shopping cart component that provides the data and UI for adding, removing and updating items in the cart.
- A checkout component that provides the data and UI for entering shipping and billing information, applying discounts and coupons, etc.
- A payment component that provides the data and UI for choosing and processing payment methods such as credit card, PayPal, etc.
- A review component that provides the data and UI for rating and reviewing books after purchase.

Each component can be developed by a different team using a different technology stack. For example, the product catalog component can be developed using React and GraphQL, the shopping cart component can be developed using Angular and RESTful APIs, the checkout component can be developed using Vue and Firebase, etc. Each component can also be deployed and updated separately on different servers or domains.

To compose your application from these components, you need to define how they interact with each other through APIs and events. For example, you can define an API for the product catalog component that exposes endpoints for querying books by various criteria. You can also define an event for the shopping cart component that emits a message when an item is added to or removed from the cart. You can then use these APIs and events to connect your components together and create a seamless user experience.

== What are the benefits of Module Federation + Composable Commerce?

By using Module Federation + Composable Commerce, you can achieve the following benefits:

- *Faster time to market*: You can reuse existing code and components from different sources without having to rebuild or redeploy them. You can also update or replace any component at any time without affecting the rest of the system.
- *Greater flexibility and scalability*: You can choose the best-of-breed vendors that provide the functionality you need for each business capability, such as product catalog, checkout, payment, etc. You can also scale each component independently according to your traffic and performance needs.
- *Better customer experience*: You can deliver consistent and engaging product experiences across multiple channels and touchpoints, such as web, mobile, social media, etc. You can also customize and optimize each component according to your customer preferences and behavior.

For example, suppose you want to add a new feature to your e-commerce application that allows customers to create personalized book recommendations based on their preferences. You can use composable commerce to achieve this by:

- Reusing an existing component that provides a survey service to collect customer preferences.
- Developing a new component that provides a recommendation engine to generate book suggestions based on customer preferences.
- Integrating these components with your existing product catalog component using APIs and events.
- Deploying these components separately without affecting the rest of the application or requiring downtime.

This way, you can deliver this new feature faster, cheaper and more reliably than if you had to modify your monolithic application.

== How does Module Federation + Composable Commerce work?

Module Federation + Composable Commerce works by breaking down your ecommerce solution into modular building blocks called Packaged Business Capabilities (PBCs). Each PBC represents a specific business function, such as product search, cart, reviews, etc. Each PBC can be deployed and scaled independently, and can communicate with other PBCs via APIs. You can choose the PBCs that suit your business requirements from different vendors or sources, or create your own PBCs if needed. You can then compose them together into a custom ecommerce application that meets your specific needs.

== Migration to Composable Commerce using Module Federation

Module federation is a feature of Webpack 5 that allows you to dynamically load modules from remote applications at runtime. It also enables you to share modules across different applications without duplicating code or creating dependencies. Module federation can help you migrate your existing e-commerce application to a composable commerce architecture by allowing you to:

- Split your monolithic application into smaller modules that can be loaded on demand by different applications.
- Create a shell application that acts as a container for loading and rendering different modules based on the user's context and actions.
- Share common modules such as authentication,  navigation, UI components, etc.across different applications to ensure consistency and avoid duplication.
- Leverage existing modules from third-party vendors or open source projects to enhance your application's functionality and user experience.

To use module federation, you need to:

- Configure Webpack 5 in each module and shell application to expose and consume remote modules using the `ModuleFederationPlugin`.
- Define the entry points, dependencies and fallbacks for each remote module using the `exposes`, `remotes` and `shared` options in the plugin configuration.
- Use dynamic imports or custom hooks to load and use remote modules in your shell or module applications.

In this example, you have four bundles:

- **Shell**: This is the main bundle that provides the layout and navigation of your application. It also acts as the host for the other bundles
and consumes their modules.
- **Catalog**: This bundle exposes a product list component that displays the products from a product catalog service.
- **Cart**: This bundle exposes a cart component that displays the items in the shopping cart and allows the user to update or remove them. It also communicates with a cart service to persist the cart data.
- **Checkout**: This bundle exposes a checkout component that guides the user through the checkout process. It also communicates with a checkout service to handle the payment and order confirmation.

You can follow these steps to migrate your e-commerce application using these bundles:

1. Create four separate module applications for each bundle: `shell-app`, `catalog-app`, `cart-app` and `checkout-app`. Each module application should contain the logic, data and UI components related to its bundle. For example, the `catalog-app` should contain the product catalog service, the product list component, etc.

[source, javascript]
----
// src/ProductList.js
import React from "react";
import { useQuery } from "@apollo/client";
import { GET_ALL_BOOKS } from "./queries";

function ProductList() {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_ALL_BOOKS);

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;

  const { books } = data;

  return (
    <div className="product-list">
      <h1>Books</h1>
      <ul>
        {books.map((book) => (
          <li key={book.id}>
            <a href={`/product/${book.id}`}>{book.title}</a>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ProductList;
----

2. Create a shell application that will act as a container for loading and rendering different module applications based on the user's context and actions. The shell application should contain the common modules such as authentication, navigation, UI components, etc.that are shared across all bundles. The shell application should also contain a router that will determine which module application to load based on the URL path.

[source, javascript]
----
// src/Shell.js

import React from "react";
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from "react-router-dom";
import Header from "./Header";
import Footer from "./Footer";

function Shell() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <div className="shell">
        <Header />
        {/* render module applications based on route */}
        <Footer />
      </div>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default Shell;
----

The previous chapter was:

3. Configure Webpack 5 in each module and shell application using the `ModuleFederationPlugin`. For example, in the `catalog-app`, you should expose the product list component as a remote module using the `exposes` option:

[source, javascript]
----
// webpack.config.js
const ModuleFederationPlugin = require("webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin");

module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name: "catalog",
      filename: "remoteEntry.js",
      exposes: {
        "./ProductList": "./src/ProductList",
      },
      shared: {
        // specify shared dependencies
        react: { singleton: true },
        "react-router-dom": { singleton: true },
        "@apollo/client": { singleton: true },
      },
    }),
  ],
};
----

In the shell application, you should consume the product list component as a remote module using the `remotes` option:

[source, javascript]
----
// webpack.config.js
const ModuleFederationPlugin = require("webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin");

module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name: "shell",
      filename: "remoteEntry.js",
      remotes: {
        catalog: "catalog@http://localhost:3001/remoteEntry.js",
      },
      shared: {
        // specify shared dependencies
        react: { singleton: true },
        "react-router-dom": { singleton: true },
      },
    }),
  ],
};
----

4. Use dynamic imports or custom hooks to load and use remote modules in your shell or module applications. For example, in the shell application, you can use React.lazy() to load and render the product list component from the `catalog-app` when the user navigates to `/products`:

[source, javascript]
----
// src/Shell.js
import React from "react";
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Header from "./Header";
import Footer from "./Footer";

const ProductList = React.lazy(() =>
  import("catalog/ProductList")
);

function Shell() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <div className="shell">
        <Header />
        {/* render module applications based on route */}
        <Route path="/products">
          <React.Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
            <ProductList />
          </React.Suspense>
        </Route>
        {/* render other routes */}
        <Footer />
      </div>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default Shell;
----

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for other module applications such as `cart-app` and `checkout-app`. For example, in the `cart-app`, you can expose the cart component as a remote module:

[source, javascript]
----
// webpack.config.js
const ModuleFederationPlugin = require("webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin");

module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name: "cart",
      filename: "remoteEntry.js",
      exposes: {
        "./Cart": "./src/Cart",
      },
      shared: {
        // specify shared dependencies
        react: { singleton: true },
        "react-router-dom": { singleton: true },
        axios: { singleton: true },
      },
    }),
  ],
};
----

In the shell application, you can consume the cart component as a remote module:

[source, javascript]
----
// webpack.config.js
const ModuleFederationPlugin = require("webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin");

module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name: "shell",
      filename: "remoteEntry.js",
      remotes: {
        catalog: "catalog@http://localhost:3001/remoteEntry.js",
        cart: "cart@http://localhost:3002/remoteEntry.js",
      },
      shared: {
        // specify shared dependencies
        react: { singleton: true },
        "react-router-dom": { singleton: true },
      },
    }),
  ],
};
----

And use React.lazy() to load and render the cart component from the `cart-app` when the user navigates to `/cart`:

[source, javascript]
----
// src/Shell.js
import React from "react";
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Header from "./Header";
import Footer from "./Footer";

const ProductList = React.lazy(() =>
  import("catalog/ProductList")
);

const Cart = React.lazy(() =>
  import("cart/Cart")
);

function Shell() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <div className="shell">
        <Header />
        {/* render module applications based on route */}
        <Route path="/products">
          <React.Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
            <ProductList />
          </React.Suspense>
        </Route>
        <Route path="/cart">
          <React.Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
            <Cart />
          </React.Suspense>
        </Route>
        {/* render other routes */}
        <Footer />
      </div>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default Shell;
----

6. Deploy each module and shell application separately on different servers or domains. For example, you can deploy `catalog-app` on http://localhost:3001/, `cart-app` on http://localhost:3002/, and `shell-app` on http://localhost:3003/.

7. Test your composable commerce application by accessing http://localhost:3003/ in your browser.

== Best Practices for Composable Commerce with Module Federation

To ensure a successful migration to composable commerce with module federation, you should follow some best practices such as:

- Design your modules based on business domains or functionalities rather than technical layers or features. This will help you achieve high cohesion and low coupling among your modules.
- Define clear contracts and interfaces for your modules using APIs and events. This will help you ensure interoperability and compatibility among your modules.
- Use versioning and semantic versioning for your modules to manage changes and updates without breaking dependencies.
- Use feature flags or toggles to enable or disable features or functionalities in your modules without redeploying them.
- Use testing tools such as Jest or Cypress to test your modules individually and integrally. This will help you ensure quality and reliability of your modules.
- Use monitoring tools such as Sentry or New Relic to track performance, errors and usage of your modules. This will help you optimize and troubleshoot your modules.

For example, suppose you want to update the cart component in the `cart-app` to show more information about the items such as quantity, price, subtotal, etc. You can use semantic versioning to indicate that this is a minor update that adds new functionality without breaking existing functionality. You can also use feature flags to enable this new functionality only for a subset of users for testing purposes. You can then deploy the updated `cart-app` without affecting the rest of the application or requiring downtime.

== Conclusion

Composable commerce with module federation is a powerful way to migrate your existing e-commerce application to a modular, flexible and scalable architecture. It allows you to leverage existing components from different sources or create your own components that can be composed together to create a customized user experience. It also enables you to update or replace components without affecting the rest of the application or requiring downtime.
