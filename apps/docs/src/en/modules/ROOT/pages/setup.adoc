= Setting up Module Federation

Module Federation is a feature of Webpack that allows you to share code between micro-frontends in a decentralized way. This documentation is intended for beginner users and will guide you through the process of setting up Module Federation.

== Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have a fresh version of Node.js installed. The current Long Term Support (LTS) release is an ideal starting point. You may run into a variety of issues with the older versions as they may be missing functionality webpack and/or its related packages require.

- You need to have `Node.js` and `npm` installed on your machine.
- You need to have a basic understanding of front-end development concepts.
- You need to have multiple applications that can load JavaScript modules

For more detailed information on installation of Webpack 5, please, refer to the official https://webpack.js.org/guides/installation/[Installation Instructions]

== Installation Instructions

To install Module Federation, follow these steps:

- Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory.
- Run the following command to install Webpack and its dependencies:

`npm install webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server --save-dev`

- Create a Webpack configuration file in the root of each application that will be using Module Federation.
- In each configuration file, add the following code to enable Module Federation:

const { ModuleFederationPlugin } = require("webpack").container;

[,json]
----
module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
	new ModuleFederationPlugin({
  	// ...
	}),
  ],
};
----

== Configuration Options

Once you have enabled Module Federation in your Webpack configuration files, you can start configuring it. The following options are available:

- name (required): The name of the application module.
- filename (optional): The filename of the remote entry file.
- exposes (optional): An object that maps local module names to the modules that should be exposed to other applications.
- remotes (optional): An object that maps the names of remote applications to the URLs where they are hosted.
- shared (optional): An object that lists the modules that should be shared between applications.

== Using Module Federation

To use Module Federation, you need to:

. Identify the modules you want to share between applications.
. Add those modules to a shared package or repository.
. Make sure that each application has access to the shared package or repository.
. Configure each application's Webpack configuration file to use Module Federation.
. Use the shared modules in your applications as needed.

For more information and advanced configuration options, please refer to the official Webpack documentation.
