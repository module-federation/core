You can browse the subdirectories on GitHub or clone the repository to your local machine.

To clone the repository, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/module-federation/module-federation-examples.git
----

Then, navigate to the subfolder of your choice and follow the instructions in the README file. Most of the examples and demos require you to install dependencies and run a development server using npm or yarn commands. For example:

[source,bash]
----
cd basic-host-remote # change directory to the example folder
npm install # install dependencies
npm start # start the development server
----

You can then open your browser and visit the URLs specified in the README file to see the example or demo in action.
