= Configuring TailwindCSS with Module Federation

== Introduction

Integrating TailwindCSS with Module Federation presents unique challenges due to their differing approaches to resource management. TailwindCSS, a utility-first CSS framework, dynamically generates CSS classes based on your project's source code. Module Federation, on the other hand, enables seamless sharing of code between different frontend applications. This article explores the complexities and provides practical solutions for using TailwindCSS within a Module Federation context.

== Understanding the Challenge

=== TailwindCSS in Isolation

In standard scenarios, TailwindCSS efficiently generates only the CSS classes used in your code. This lean approach results in optimized CSS files tailored to your application's needs.

=== The Complication with Module Federation

Problems arise when integrating TailwindCSS into Module Federation setups. Imagine multiple applications ("remotes") sharing components and each generating its own TailwindCSS classes. These applications can inadvertently interfere with each other due to the global nature of CSS. 

=== Illustrative Example

Consider two applications, `app1` and `app2`, each using TailwindCSS:

==== Application #1 

`app1`'s code:

[source, javascript]
----
<div className="block sm:hidden md:block">
  <span></span>
</div>
----

When built, it generates the following CSS:

[source, css]
----
.block {
  display: block;
}
@media (min-width: 640px) {
  .sm\:hidden {
    display: none;
  }
}
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .md\:block {
    display: block;
  }
}
----

The display behavior of the `div` element within App 1 varies according to the screen size:

1. **Small Screens**: When the screen size is less than 640 pixels, the `div` is visible.
2. **Medium Screens (640px to 767px)**: As the screen size expands to 640 pixels or more, the `div` becomes hidden.
3. **Large Screens (768px and above)**: Once the screen size reaches 768 pixels, the `div` becomes visible again.

==== Application #2 

`app2`'s code:

[source, javascript]
----
<div className="sm:hidden">
  <span></span>
</div>
----

This code generates the following CSS:

[source, css]
----
@media (min-width: 640px) {
  .sm\:hidden {
    display: none;
  }
}
----

*Initial Observation:*

At a first look, the code for App 1 and App 2 seems appropriate. However, a conflict arises when these applications are loaded together on the same page.

*Conflict Explanation:*

- **Global Nature of CSS**: CSS rules are inherently global. When multiple applications share the same environment, their CSS rules can interact and interfere with each other.
- **Specific Case of Conflict**: In this scenario, both `sm:hidden` and `md:block` classes from App 1 and App 2 have equal specificity in CSS. This equality leads to a situation where the latter class in the CSS file overrides the former.
- **Resulting Issue**: The `sm:hidden` class from App 2 overrides the `md:block` class from App 1 when the screen size increases to 768px. Consequently, the `div` in App 1 fails to appear as intended.

*CSS Conflict Demonstration:*

[source, css]
----
/* App 1 CSS */
@media (min-width: 640px) {
  .sm\:hidden {
    display: none;
  }
}
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  /* Intended to override sm:hidden */
  .md\:block {
    display: block;
  }
}

/* App 2 CSS */
@media (min-width: 640px) {
  /* Overrides md:block due to later position */
  .sm\:hidden {
    display: none;
  }
}
----

*Solution Strategy:*

To effectively address this problem, it's crucial to prevent the duplication of class names across different applications. This approach involves ensuring that each application has unique class names or employing strategies such as CSS scoping or CSS-in-JS libraries to isolate styles within each application context. This can be achieved in several ways, so let's examine a couple of popular approaches.

== Solutions for TailwindCSS and Module Federation

=== Approach 1: Unified TailwindCSS Classes

==== Issue Identification:

The fundamental issue stems from the separate generation and integration of multiple CSS files. This process results in the overwriting of CSS classes, causing styling conflicts.

===== Suggested Solution and Its Challenges:

- **Consolidating TailwindCSS Classes into One File**: The proposed solution is to amalgamate all TailwindCSS classes into a single file and include it just once in the project.

- **Practicality and Limitations**: 
  - **File Size Concerns**: This method, while seemingly straightforward, leads to the creation of an excessively large CSS file, potentially spanning several hundred megabytes. Such a file size is generally impractical and not feasible for most web applications.
  - **Compatibility Issues with TailwindCSS Version 3**: It's important to note that TailwindCSS has discontinued support for this kind of functionality starting from version 3. This change further complicates the implementation of this solution, making it less viable for projects using the latest versions of TailwindCSS.

=== Approach 2: Prefixing TailwindCSS Classes

==== Strategy Overview:

This method involves using the `prefix` configuration option in TailwindCSS to assign unique prefixes for each application, thereby resolving class conflicts.

==== Implementation Details:

===== Application 1 Configuration:

- *tailwind.config.cjs:*
+
[source, javascript]
----
module.exports = {
  prefix: 'app1-',
};
----

- **Usage in Application 1 (JSX)**:
+
[source, javascript]
----
<div className="app1-block sm:app1-hidden md:app1-block">
  <span></span>
</div>
----

- **Generated CSS for Application 1**:
+
[source, css]
----
.app1-block {
  display: block;
}
@media (min-width: 640px) {
  .sm\:app1-hidden {
    display: none;
  }
}
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .md\:app1-block {
    display: block;
  }
}
----

===== Application 2 Configuration:

- `tailwind.config.cjs`:
+
[source, javascript]
----
module.exports = {
  prefix: 'app2-',
};
----

- **Usage in Application 2 (JSX)**:
+
[source, javascript]
----
<div className="sm:app2-hidden">
  <span></span>
</div>
----

- **Generated CSS for Application 2**:
+
[source, css]
----
@media (min-width: 640px) {
  .sm\:app2-hidden {
    display: none;
  }
}
----

==== Unique CSS Classes and Resolution of Conflicts:

With this approach, CSS classes become unique to each application, effectively eliminating any conflicts.

==== Drawbacks:

- **Longer Class Names**: Developers have to write more extended class names, which can be less efficient.
- **Context Switching Between Projects**: Developers need to adapt to different prefixes when switching between projects, which can be counterproductive.
- **Challenges in Code Sharing**: This method complicates code sharing (like copy-pasting) across applications, which is a significant advantage of using TailwindCSS.

=== Approach 3: Implementing twin.macro for Unique Class Names

==== Strategy Description:

This method involves utilizing `twin.macro`, a library that enables the use of TailwindCSS class names to generate CSS-in-JS code. The key benefit of this approach is that it dynamically creates unique class names at runtime, effectively preventing any conflicts across applications in a module federation setup.

==== Implementation Insights:

- **Dynamic Class Name Generation**: The CSS-in-JS code generated by `twin.macro` ensures unique class names, thus maintaining styling integrity across different applications.
- **Runtime Considerations**: While this approach is effective in resolving class conflicts, it introduces additional runtime processing. This can potentially slow down the page load and overall performance.

==== Personal Experience and Decision Rationale:

- **Chosen Solution in Practice**: This strategy was selected when encountering a similar problem, primarily due to its ability to preserve an excellent developer experience.
- **Developer Experience Priority**: The choice to use `twin.macro` was driven by the need to maintain a smooth and efficient workflow for developers, a critical aspect for the success of the project. 

By balancing the technical solution with the developer experience, this approach offers a practical way to handle class name conflicts in a module federation environment, despite the trade-off in runtime performance.

=== Approach 4: The NX-Way of Setting Up Module Federation with TailwindCSS

==== Prerequisites

For those new to micro-frontends and Module Federation, I recommend starting with the "Getting Started with Module Federation" article, which provides an excellent foundation for understanding these concepts.

====  Adding TailwindCSS in an Nx Workspace

The Nx framework provides a structured way to integrate TailwindCSS within a Module Federation setup.

1. **Installation**: Start by installing TailwindCSS and its dependencies:
+
[source, shell]
----
npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
----
+
2. **Setting Up Tailwind**: For each application in your workspace, set up TailwindCSS:
+
[source, bash]
----
npx nx generate @nrwl/angular:setup-tailwind [remoteName]
----
+
Replace `[remoteName]` with your application's name. This step configures `tailwind.config.js` and updates the global stylesheet with Tailwind imports.
+
3. **Adjusting Global Stylesheet**: In a micro-frontend architecture, the global stylesheet isn't exposed, necessitating a different approach. For the moment, remove the Tailwind imports from the global stylesheet:
+
[source, css]
----
/* styles.scss */
/* Remove Tailwind imports */
----

==== Implementing the Proxy Pattern

To share Tailwind styles across micro-frontends, we employ a ProxyComponent pattern.

1. **Creating the ProxyComponent**: This component acts as a wrapper for the entire micro-frontend. Include the Tailwind imports in the ProxyComponent's stylesheet:
+
[source, css]
----
/* proxy.component.scss */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
----
+
2. **Updating the ProxyComponent**: Set its `ViewEncapsulation` to `None` to prevent Angular from encapsulating the styles. This ensures that the styles behave globally for all child components:
+
[source, typescript]
----
/* proxy.component.ts */
import { Component, ViewEncapsulation } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
import { RouterOutlet } from '@angular/router';

@Component({
  selector: 'tailwind-microfrontends-proxy',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule, RouterOutlet],
  templateUrl: './proxy.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./proxy.component.scss'],
  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None
})
export class ProxyComponent {}
----
+
3. **Defining Proxy Routes**: Configure the routes to use the ProxyComponent, ensuring that the Tailwind styles are included:
+
[source, typescript]
----
/* proxy.routes.ts */
import { Route } from '@angular/router';

export const routes: Route[] = [
  {
    path: '',
    loadComponent: async () =>
      (await import('./proxy.component')).ProxyComponent,
    loadChildren: async () =>
      (await import('@tailwind-microfrontends/remote-lib')).routes,
  },
];
----

=== Approach 5: PostCSS Prefixing

A new approach involves a PostCSS plugin that prefixes class names post-TailwindCSS processing. Additionally, a utility function appends prefixes at runtime:

- Example usage:
+
[source, javascript]
----
const tw = (...classes) => /* function logic */
<div className={tw('sm:hidden md:block')}>
  <span></span>
</div>;
----

- PostCSS configuration:
+
[source, javascript]
----
module.exports = {
plugins: {
  tailwindcss: {},
  autoprefixer: {},
  'postcss-prefixer': { prefix: 'app1-', },
},
};
----

This method combines build-time processing with runtime adjustment, offering a balance between developer experience and functionality.
