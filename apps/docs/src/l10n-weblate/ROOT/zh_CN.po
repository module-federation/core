"The following guide is based on a project that used Webpack's "
"ModuleFederationPlugin to share both component and vendor library modules "
"between two web applications. The challenge was to share two-digit-number of "
"different vendor modules, but bundle them into one common vendors chunk to "
"reduce the network load of having dozens of different requests "
"simultaneously. The solution was to bundle all different vendor bundles into "
"one using `SplitChunksPlugin`, resulting in only one request from the host "
"app to the remote app when the vendor library is needed."
