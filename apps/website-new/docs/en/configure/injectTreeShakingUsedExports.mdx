# injectTreeShakingUsedExports

Whether to inject the exports used by `shared` into the bundler runtime.

- Type: `boolean`
- Required: No
- Default: `undefined`

This option controls whether the actual used exports from shared modules are injected into the bundler runtime, enabling more precise dependency management and optimizations.

If you are using `mode: 'server-calc'`, it is recommended to set this option to `false`.
