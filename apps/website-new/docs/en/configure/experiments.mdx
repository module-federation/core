# Experiments

The `experiments` configuration is used to enable experimental capabilities in the plugin.

- Example

```ts
new ModuleFederationPlugin({
  name: '@demo/host',
  experiments: {
    asyncStartup: true,
    externalRuntime: false,
    provideExternalRuntime: false
  },
  shared: {
    react: {
      singleton: true,
    },
    'react-dom': {
      singleton: true,
    },
  },
  //...
});
```

## asyncStartup

- Type: `boolean`
- Required: No
- Default: `false`

When `asyncStartup` is enabled, all Module Federation entrypoints will initialize asynchronously by default. This means:

- No need for manual `import()` statements at the top of your app (e.g., `import('./bootstrap')`)
- All entrypoints automatically handle async initialization
- Prevention of "eager consumption" errors through automatic async handling

:::warning
When using this mode, all entrypoints will initialize asynchronously. If you're manually requiring a bundled entrypoint or exposing a UMD library, it will return a promise resolving to the exports.
:::

## externalRuntime

- Type: `boolean`
- Required: No
- Default: `false`

After setting `true`, the external MF runtime will be used and the runtime provided by the consumer will be used. (Please make sure your consumer has `provideExternalRuntime: true` set, otherwise it will not run properly!)

## provideExternalRuntime

- Type: `boolean`
- Required: No
- Default: `false`

::: warning note
Make sure to only configure it on the topmost consumer! If multiple consumers inject runtime at the same time, the ones executed later will not overwrite the existing runtime.
:::

Setting `true` will inject the MF runtime at the consumer.
