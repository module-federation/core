# Experiments

The `experiments` configuration is used to enable experimental capabilities in the plugin.

- Example

```ts
new ModuleFederationPlugin({
  name: '@demo/host',
  experiments: {
    federationRuntime: 'hoisted'
  },
  shared: {
    react: {
      singleton: true,
    },
    'react-dom': {
      singleton: true,
    },
  },
  //...
});
```

## federationRuntime

- Type: `enum`
- Required: No
- Default: `false`
- Options: `false | "hoisted"`

### `Hoisted` Runtime

When the runtime is `hoisted`, the following occurs:

These configurations are useful for:

- Setting or using`runtimeChunk: 'single'`.
- Avoiding the `import()` at the top of the app or in the entry point of user code to prevent eager consumption errors. In the past, this was often mandatory and commonly seen as `import('./bootstrap.js')` in example apps.
- Moving the Module Federation runtime packages into runtime chunks, keeping them out of the entry point - reducing code duplication

1) Optimizations

The `module-federation/runtime` is patched onto entrypoints. This causes multiple copies to exist in some builds.
It also causes some "eager consumption" errors when chunk splitting is configured in certain ways.

This resolves a common issue with runtimeChunk: single

2) Async startup

:::warning
This mode allows for async startup. When exporting a UMD library, it can return a promise resolving to the export.
If you manually require() an entrypoint in Node, it sets module.exports to Promise.resolve(exports).
:::

Entrypoint startup will switch to "active" initialization and use async dependency startup.

You will no longer need a mandatory `import('./bootsrtap')` dynamic import in order for consumers / hosts to function.
There should be no "eager consumption" errors possible, as the initialization of the files themselves behave as async chunks.

3) Eager Runtime Access

Instead of federation runtime initilizing in the entrypoint code, it is initialized in a RuntimeModule, within the webpack runtime.
This allows module federation to be avaliable ahead of time, thus enabling "Async Startup" capabilities etc.

## externalRuntime

- Type: `boolean`
- Required: No
- Default: `false`

After setting `true`, the external MF runtime will be used and the runtime provided by the consumer will be used. (Please make sure your consumer has `provideExternalRuntime: true` set, otherwise it will not run properly!)

## provideExternalRuntime

- Type: `boolean`
- Required: No
- Default: `false`

::: warning note
Make sure to only configure it on the topmost consumer! If multiple consumers inject runtime at the same time, the ones executed later will not overwrite the existing runtime.
:::

Setting `true` will inject the MF runtime at the consumer.
