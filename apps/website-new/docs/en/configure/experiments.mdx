# Experiments

The `experiments` configuration is used to enable experimental capabilities in the plugin.

- Example

```ts
new ModuleFederationPlugin({
  name: '@demo/host',
  experiments: {
    asyncStartup: true,
    externalRuntime: false,
    provideExternalRuntime: false,
    nodeModulesReconstructedLookup: true
  },
  shared: {
    react: {
      singleton: true,
    },
    'react-dom': {
      singleton: true,
    },
  },
  //...
});
```

## asyncStartup

- Type: `boolean`
- Required: No
- Default: `false`

When `asyncStartup` is enabled, all Module Federation entrypoints will initialize asynchronously by default. This means:

- No need for manual `import()` statements at the top of your app (e.g., `import('./bootstrap')`)
- All entrypoints automatically handle async initialization
- Prevention of "eager consumption" errors through automatic async handling

:::warning
When using this mode, all entrypoints will initialize asynchronously. If you're manually requiring a bundled entrypoint or exposing a UMD library, it will return a promise resolving to the exports.
:::

## nodeModulesReconstructedLookup

- Type: `boolean`
- Required: No
- Default: `false`

Enables enhanced module resolution for packages located in `node_modules`, particularly for modules that use relative imports internally.

**What it solves**: When a shared module uses relative imports (e.g., `import './directory/thing'`), Module Federation might not correctly recognize these as matching your shared configuration. This experiment reconstructs the full path and extracts the proper module name to enable correct sharing.

```ts
// Simple example
new ModuleFederationPlugin({
  name: 'host',
  experiments: {
    nodeModulesReconstructedLookup: true
  },
  shared: {
    'shared': {},
    'shared/directory/': {}
  }
});
```

For detailed examples and explanation of how this works with relative paths, see [Advanced Sharing: Node Modules Path Resolution](/configure/advanced-sharing#node-modules-path-resolution).

## externalRuntime

- Type: `boolean`
- Required: No
- Default: `false`

After setting `true`, the external MF runtime will be used and the runtime provided by the consumer will be used. (Please make sure your consumer has `provideExternalRuntime: true` set, otherwise it will not run properly!)

## provideExternalRuntime

- Type: `boolean`
- Required: No
- Default: `false`

::: warning note
Make sure to only configure it on the topmost consumer! If multiple consumers inject runtime at the same time, the ones executed later will not overwrite the existing runtime.
:::

Setting `true` will inject the MF runtime at the consumer.
