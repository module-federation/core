# shareStrategy

- Type: `'version-first' | 'loaded-first'`
- Required: No
- Default: `'version-first'`

Control the loading strategy of shared dependencies:

- `'version-first'`: Version priority, ensuring that the highest version of shared dependencies is used. **All remotes entry files will be automatically loaded during initialization** to register shared dependencies and ensure version compatibility. This strategy is recommended when there are strict version requirements.

- `'loaded-first'`: Prioritize reuse of already loaded shared dependencies. Remotes are loaded on-demand rather than during initialization. This strategy is recommended when you want to reuse loaded dependencies for performance.

:::warning Offline Remote Considerations

The `'version-first'` strategy automatically loads remote entry files during application startup. If any remote is offline or unreachable, this will cause application startup failures unless proper error handling is implemented using `errorLoadRemote` hooks or retry mechanisms.

See [Error Load Remote Solutions](../blog/error-load-remote) for handling offline remotes.
