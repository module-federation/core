# shareStrategy

- Type: `'version-first' | 'loaded-first'`
- Required: No
- Default: `'version-first'` (set by webpack plugin/bundler runtime)

Control the loading strategy of shared dependencies:

- `'version-first'`: Version priority, ensuring that the highest version of shared dependencies is used. **All remotes entry files will be automatically loaded during initialization** to register shared dependencies and ensure version compatibility. This strategy is recommended when there are strict version requirements.

- `'loaded-first'`: Prioritize reuse of already loaded shared dependencies. Remotes are loaded on-demand rather than during initialization. This strategy is recommended when you want to reuse loaded dependencies for performance.

:::warning Offline Remote Considerations

The `'version-first'` strategy automatically loads remote entry files during application startup. If any remote is offline or unreachable, this will cause application startup failures unless proper error handling is implemented using `errorLoadRemote` hooks or retry mechanisms.

The `'loaded-first'` strategy defers remote loading until modules are actually requested, which means offline remotes only cause failures when those specific remotes are accessed, not during application startup.

For production applications with potential network issues, consider:
- Using `'loaded-first'` strategy for better resilience
- Implementing retry mechanisms via plugins
- Adding proper error boundaries and fallback components

See [Error Load Remote Solutions](../blog/error-load-remote) for handling offline remotes.
