# shareScope

`shareScope` specifies which shared dependency pools (share scopes) a producer (remote) participates in. You can think of a share scope as a named shared-dependency pool: dependencies are only reused within the same scope.

- Type: `string | string[]`
- Required: No
- Default: `'default'`

## What It Does

- Controls which share scopes a remote initializes at runtime.
- Works with `shared[*].shareScope`: a shared dependency only participates in the scope it is assigned to.
- Works with `remotes[remote].shareScope`: the host must align the scopes it wants to reuse with the remote, otherwise missing scopes are treated as empty and cannot be reused.

## Examples

### Single Scope (Default)

```ts
new ModuleFederationPlugin({
  name: 'app_remote',
  shareScope: 'default',
});
```

### Multiple Scopes (Isolated Shared Pools)

```ts
new ModuleFederationPlugin({
  name: 'app_remote',
  shareScope: ['default', 'scope1'],
  shared: {
    react: {
      singleton: true,
      requiredVersion: false,
      shareScope: 'default',
    },
    '@company/design-system': {
      singleton: true,
      requiredVersion: false,
      shareScope: 'scope1',
    },
  },
});
```

## Notes

- `shareScope` declares which share scopes this remote initializes. It does not automatically put dependencies into those scopes; that is controlled by each `shared` entry's `shareScope`.
- To actually reuse dependencies across apps, the host and remote typically need to agree on the same share scopes for that remote. See [remotes.shareScope](./remotes#sharescope).
