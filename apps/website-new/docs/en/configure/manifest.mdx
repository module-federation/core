# manifest

- Type: `boolean | PluginManifestOptions`
- Default value: `undefined`

Used to control whether to generate a manifest and the corresponding generation configuration.

The `PluginManifestOptions` types are as follows:

```ts
interface PluginManifestOptions {
  filePath?: string;
  disableAssetsAnalyze?: boolean;
  fileName?: string;
}
```

## filePath

- Type: `string`
- Default value: `undefined`

manifest filePath

## fileName

- Type: `string`
- Default value: `'mf-manifest.json'`

manifest fileName

## disableAssetsAnalyze

:::warning
It is not recommended to set this configuration. After setting, the preload function will be disabled!
:::

- Type: `boolean`
- Required: No
- Default value: `undefined`

When analyzing assets in complex projects, it can take a long time. By setting this option to `true`, asset analysis will be disabled, optimizing build time.
If the project is purely consumer-oriented, it will be set to `true` in dev by default.
If set to `true`, the `shared` and `exposes` fields will not be present in the manifest, and `assets` will not be present in `remotes`.
