# Feature Navigation

Here, you can learn about the main features supported by Module Federation. Unlike the built-in Module Federation in Webpack and Rspack, the Module Federation here is based on the capabilities of the Builder construction tool, providing richer capabilities to meet the various demands of large-scale web application development.
