# Error Catalog

This section is a collection of common issues related to the implementation of `Module Federation` in general.
The main goal is to provide additional context and solution paths for beginners not familiar with the fundamental ways of how `Module Federation` is working at its core.

## Unable to use `module-name`'s URL with `module-name`_provider's globalName to get remoteEntry exports
#### Error Message
:::danger Browser Error Message
Uncaught (in promise)
Error: [ Federation Runtime ]:
  Unable to use `module-name`'s URL with `module-name`_provider's globalName to get remoteEntry exports.
  Possible reasons could be:

   `origin`/modules/`module-name`/static/js/`module-name`_provider.js' is not the correct URL, or the remoteEntry resource is incorrect.

   `module-name`_provider' cannot be used to get remoteEntry exports in the window object.
:::

#### Solution
Set `shareStrategy` as `'loaded-first'` host
```ts title="modern.config.js"
{
    ...
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
        ...,
        shareStrategy: 'loaded-first',
      })
  }
```
3. Optional: If you are running `module-federation` in a Docker environment, make sure to adapt the following fields in your configs of all `hosts` and `remotes`:
```ts title="modern.config.js"
{
    rspack: (config, {appendPlugins}) => {
        ...
        config.publicPath = "auto";
        config.output.uniqueName = "module-name";
        delete config.optimization?.splitChunks;
      },
      appendPlugins([
        new ModuleFederationPlugin({
            ...,
            runtime: false,
        })
      ])
  }
```

## Resolve error: Cant't resolve `module-namespace`/`module-component` in `implementation-path`
#### Error Message
:::danger Browser Error Message
Resolve error: Cant't resolve `module-namespace`/`module-component` in `implementation-path`

var Component = /*#__PURE__*/ lazy(function() {}
  return import("`module-namespace`/`module-component`)});
:::

#### Solution
When checking your browser network traffic you might see that no `mf-manifest.json` file is being loaded. This is because the `module-namespace` is not being resolved correctly.
Make sure the path to the actual exposed `module_provider.js` file in your remote is resolving with status code 200.

Warning: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component. This could happen for one of the following reasons:

You might have mismatching versions of React and the renderer (such as React DOM)

You might be breaking the Rules of Hooks

You might have more than one copy of React in the same app

#### Solution
This error occurs when you work a lot with `shared-dependencies`. After loading modules it is not clear which version of each shared-dependency should be used. To resolve this, switch to the shared notation of the option field `shared`
The object notation allows for more control of the shared-dependencies.

For us, the option `singleton` is mandatory to consolidate all versions of shared-dependencies to the lowest matching version.

In addition, the option `eager` encapsulates all shared-dependencies into a dedicated output entry. This can be helpful to solve possible race-condition artifacts in the runtime. The drawback which this option is a slightly increased network traffic because of the additional output entry.

```ts title="modern.config.js"
{
    ...
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
            ...,
         // Default basic configuration
         // shared: [
         //   'react',
         //   'react-dom',
         //   'my-custom-module'
         // ]

         // Configuration with more specificity
            shared: {
                react: { singleton: true, eager: true },
                'react-dom': { singleton: true, eager: true },
                'my-custom-module': { singleton: true, eager: true },
                ...
            },
        })
      ])
  }
```

#### Solution 1

Example scenario: you have a npm package with `eager` remote imports in it (like `import Button from 'myRemote/button'`), and you share this npm package with `eager:true`. 
Example scenario: youre sharing a mix of package with `eager:true` and `eager:false` and the `eager:true` packages import the `eager: false` shared packages

This error occurs when a remote (oftentimes a library-like share module) contains unwanted circular dependencies between the `shared dependencies` of the remote and other consumers or the host application. If the environment is using the module Federation config `shared: { "package-name": { eager: true } }`, the rspack / webpack builder-runtime will break with this error.

To resolve this, you need to remove the `eager: true` option from the shared configuration of all connected remotes and the host application. This will prevent the shared dependencies from being loaded eagerly and will allow the remote to be loaded correctly.
Since eager consumption wraps all dependencies inside the entryFile of the remote, rspack / webpack cannot detect the specific handlers for each dependency resulting in a `undefined`.

#### Solution 2
You are missing an "async bounary" in your application. Ensure you have a dynamic import at the top of the application.
Foe example, if you have `index.js` which is your entrypoint, copy and past the contents of `index.js` into a file called `bootstrap.js`, then in `index.js` replace its code with `import('./bootstrap.js')

Alternatively you can try the hoisted runtime experiment with removes the need for a async boundary in user code. https://module-federation.io/configure/experiments.html#federationruntime
