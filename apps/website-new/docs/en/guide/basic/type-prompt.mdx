# Type rompt

Just like NPM Packages, `Module Federation` products also generate types and enjoy type hot reloading, although the products are hosted on a remote CDN.

`@module-federation/enhanced` enables the type prompt function by default. This article will introduce several common usage scenarios and specific configurations.

## Use Cases

### Generate type

Building using the build plugin provided by `@module-federation/enhanced` will automatically generate type files.

### Consume type

1. Consumer modifies `tsconfig.json`

add `paths` to `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "*": ["./@mf-types/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

2. Start consumer and provider

> info: No need to care the startup sequence of provider and consumer

After startup, the consumer will automatically pull the provider's type file.

### Type hot reload

After modifying the producer code, the consumer will automatically pull the producer's type.

### Federation Runtime API type prompt

Using `Federation Runtime`'s `loadRemote` can also enjoy type hints and type hot reloading:

### Third-party package type extraction

`Module Federation` will automatically extract third-party package types to ensure that `exposes` file types can be accessed normally.

### Nested type re-export

`Module Federation` supports nested remotes and will automatically extract the nested remotes type.

## Configuration

- [dts](../../configure/dts)：generate/load type
- [dev](../../configure/dev)：type hot reload

## FAQ

1. The project compiles in a loop and cannot be terminated

A: It is most likely caused by the compiler monitoring changes in the type folder or `dist`. Just add `@mf-types` to the ignore file.

Take webpack/rspack as an example:

```ts
config.watchOptions = {
  ignored: ['**/node_modules/**', '**/@mf-types/**'],
};
```
