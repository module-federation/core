# Chrome DevTools

The `Microfrontend` architecture differs from the traditional monolithic application development model. Its characteristics of separate development, deployment, and debugging necessitate a new set of debugging tools to meet new usage scenarios, such as: how to verify the effect of modules in actual projects when developing `Module Federation`, whether the dependencies of `Module Federation` are reused with the host environment, which `Module Federation` modules are loaded on the current page, the dependency relationships of `Module Federation`, and how the data flow between `Module Federation` works.

`Chrome DevTools` provides the following capabilities:

- Support for `Module Federation` proxy functionality, which proxies the `Module Federation` on the online page to the user's local `Module Federation`.
- Switch the version of `Module Federation` on the online page for rapid feature verification.
- Support for viewing module dependency information.
- Support for filtering specific module dependency information.

::: tip About the limitations of Chrome DevTools:
You must use `mf-manifest.json` to utilize the visualization and proxy capabilities provided by `Chrome DevTools`.

## Use Cases

Development and production environments:

- Existing modules need to be proxied, currently supporting the following scenarios:

1. Support for local server port numbers, for example, key: appA -> value: `http://localhost:3000/mf-manifest.json`, the page will directly load the `Module Federation` content from port 3000.
2. Support for using the `mf-manifest.json` file address format, for example, key: appA -> value: `https://xxx/static/mf-manifest.json`, the page will directly load the `Module Federation` content from the specified address.

- Want to see the remote dependency relationship graph.

## How to Install

1. Open the [Module Federation plugin detail page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/module-federation/aeoilchhomapofiopejjlecddfldpeom), and click the `Add to Chrome` button.

## How to Use

The plugin provides a DevTools panel:

- Press F12 to open the developer tools, select and click the `Module Federation` tab to enter the proxy page, where you can proxy and debug the dependent modules.

## Overall Interaction

As shown in the figure below, the proxy page provides options for operations such as `add new proxy module`, `producer selector`, `version or local port or custom entry`.

- Select a module that needs to be proxied on the target page by choosing the `producer selector`.
- Select or enter a specific address (including port number and address ending with `mf-manifest.json`) through `version or local port` to perform the proxy operation.
- If you need to proxy multiple modules at the same time, click the `add new proxy module` area to add the corresponding proxy modules.

## How to Proxy Locally Developed Modules to Online

- First, you need to start the Vmok producer locally.

- Then enter the successfully launched manifest address into the version selection input box on the proxy page.
- After adjusting the local producer code, the consumer page will automatically Reload.

## Common Issues

### DevTools Content is Too Crowded

You can open DevTools in a separate window.

### When Does the Configuration Take Effect

- ✅ Complies with validation rules.
- ✅ Configuration rules are checked.
- ✅ Configuration is filled in correctly, the page shows: Proxy configuration is effective, remote module retrieval is successful, the corresponding page has been automatically refreshed.


### Partial Configuration Complies with Rules

The plugin will filter out **modules that comply with the configuration rules** for proxying.
