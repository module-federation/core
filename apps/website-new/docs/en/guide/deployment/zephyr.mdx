# Deploy with Zephyr Cloud

[Zephyr Cloud](https://zephyr-cloud.io) is a zero-config deployment platform that integrates directly into your build process and provides global edge distribution for Module Federation applications.

#### How to deploy

1. Install the Zephyr plugin for your bundler (supports Webpack, Rspack, Vite, etc...):

import InstallKit from '@components/common/install-kit';

<InstallKit
  pkgName="zephyr-webpack-plugin"
/>

2. Add the plugin to your webpack configuration:

```javascript title='webpack.config.js'
import { withZephyr } from 'zephyr-webpack-plugin';
const {
  ModuleFederationPlugin,
} = require('@module-federation/enhanced/webpack');
const mfConfig = require('./module-federation.config');

module.exports = withZephyr()({
  devServer: {
    port: 2000,
  },
  output: {
    publicPath: 'http://localhost:2000/',
  },
  plugins: [new ModuleFederationPlugin(mfConfig)],
});
```

3. Build your project as usual:

```bash
npm run build
```

During the build process, your Module Federation application will be automatically deployed to Zephyr's global edge network and you'll receive a deployment URL. Zephyr Cloud handles asset optimization, dependency resolution, and provides automatic rollback capabilities for your micro-frontend applications.
