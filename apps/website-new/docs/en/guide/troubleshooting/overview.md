# Overview

Module Federation currently provides **Build Tools**, **Runtime API**, **Type Hints** and **Debugging Tools**. In order to locate the corresponding problems faster, we classify error messages. Divide them into the following categories:

* [Runtime](./runtime/RUNTIME-001)
* [Type](./type/TYPE-001)
* Build
* Debugging tools

And for the information thrown internally, specific error codes will be given. The error code consists of the error type and ID (such as **RUNTIME-001**). You can find the specified page based on the error code to learn about the cause and solution of the error.

For common problems when using third-party packages, we have placed them in the [Other](./other) chapter, such as high-frequency React multi-instance problems, etc.
