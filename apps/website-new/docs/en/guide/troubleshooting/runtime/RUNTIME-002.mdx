## Reasons

Can not get remote container `init` function.

The remote container should provide an object which value is `{ get, init }`. However, the `init` is `undefined` during this load.

## Solutions

Check in the following order:

1. Before loading the producer, enter window[remoteEntryKey] in `terminal` to check whether this object is occupied. If so, you need to rename the producer [name](../../../configure/name#name)
2. If the project builder is rspack, check whether [runtimeChunk](https://rspack.dev/config/optimization#optimizationruntimechunk) is set in the final build configuration. If so, delete this configuration.
