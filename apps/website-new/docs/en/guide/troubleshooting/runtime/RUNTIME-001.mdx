## Reasons

When the producer entry file is loaded normally, the producer will be registered in the global object (globalThis/window), which can be accessed through window[remoteEntryKey].

However, during this loading process, registered producers are inaccessible. There are three possible causes for this error:

1. The remoteEntryUrl is not right.
2. The remoteEntry file does not mount the container correctly.
3. Network problem, the resource cannot be accessed.
4. The remote type is a different format and not specified in either the plugin or in the `init` for the remotes details.

## Solutions

There are corresponding solutions for the reasons:

1. Check whether the remoteEntryUrl is correct.
  - If using manifest, check the publicPath and remoteEntry.name  fields in the manifest
2. If the project builder is rspack, check whether [runtimeChunk](https://rspack.dev/config/optimization#optimizationruntimechunk) is set in the final build configuration. If so, delete this configuration.
3. Check if the resource is externally accessible.
4. Loading a ESM remote from a non-esm host
  -  setting `type: 'module'` on the remote config
