## Reasons

The remoteEntryGlobalName should be got in globalThis if the remote entry file is loaded normally.
However, it is not available during this load. There are three possible reasons for this error:

1. The remoteEntryUrl is not right .
2. The remoteEntry file does not mount the container correctly .

## Solutions

There are corresponding solutions for the reasons:

1. Check whether the remoteEntryUrl is correct.
  - If using manifest, check the publicPath and remoteEntry.name  fields in the manifest
2. If the project builder is rspack, check whether [runtimeChunk](https://rspack.dev/config/optimization#optimizationruntimechunk) is set in the final build configuration. If so, delete this configuration.
