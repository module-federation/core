title: "RUNTIME-005 | Shared Module Not Ready for Eager Use"
description: "Troubleshooting guide for the RUNTIME-005 error, occurring when a shared module is configured as async but is attempted to be consumed eagerly without eager: true"
---

import ErrorCodeTitle from '@components/ErrorCodeTitle';

<ErrorCodeTitle code='RUNTIME-005'/>

## Reasons

After Shared is set, the corresponding dependent library will be determined to be an asynchronous module. If the asynchronous entry is not enabled and `eager: true` is not set, then this error will occur.

## Solutions

Just choose one of the two:

1. Enable asynchronous entry

import EnableAsyncEntry from '@components/en/EnableAsyncEntry'

<EnableAsyncEntry />

2. Set shared `eager: true`
