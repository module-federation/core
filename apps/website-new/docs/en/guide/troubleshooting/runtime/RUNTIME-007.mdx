import ErrorCodeTitle from '@components/ErrorCodeTitle';

<ErrorCodeTitle code='RUNTIME-007'/>

## Reasons

The remote entry is set to the version number instead of the resource address, and the deployment platform does not deliver the correct data information, causing this problem.

## Solutions

Check whether the globalSnapshot contains an object with the key `${moduleName}:${moduleInfo.version}`. If not, you need to check whether the deployment platform data delivery information link is abnormal.
