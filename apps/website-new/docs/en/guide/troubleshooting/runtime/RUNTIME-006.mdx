import ErrorCodeTitle from '@components/ErrorCodeTitle';

<ErrorCodeTitle code='RUNTIME-006'/>

## Reasons

The current shared dependency has not been loaded, so `loadShareSync` cannot be used.

## Solutions

Just choose one of the two:

1. Use `loadShare` instead of `loadShareSync`
2. Provide the [lib](../../basic/runtime#loadshare) function to the current shared dependency
