title: RUNTIME-006 | Invalid Sync Share Usage
description: Troubleshooting guide for the RUNTIME-006 error, caused by using 'loadShareSync' for a shared dependency that has not yet been loaded.
---

import ErrorCodeTitle from '@components/ErrorCodeTitle';

<ErrorCodeTitle code='RUNTIME-006'/>

## Reasons

The current shared dependency has not been loaded, so `loadShareSync` cannot be used.

## Solutions

Just choose one of the two:

1. Use `loadShare` instead of `loadShareSync`
2. Provide the [lib](../../basic/runtime#loadshare) function to the current shared dependency
