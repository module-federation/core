# Export Application

This chapter will introduce how to use `createBridgeComponent` to export your React application as a remotely loadable module.

## Installation

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

<PackageManagerTabs
  command={{
    npm: 'npm install @module-federation/bridge-react@latest',
    yarn: 'yarn add @module-federation/bridge-react@latest',
    pnpm: 'pnpm add @module-federation/bridge-react@latest',
  }}
/>

## Basic Usage

### Step 1: Create Export Entry

To export a React application, you need to create a dedicated export file that uses `createBridgeComponent` to wrap the application as a remote module.

Assuming your application entry is `App.tsx`, create a new file `export-app.tsx`:

```tsx
// ./src/export-app.tsx
import App from './App';
import { createBridgeComponent } from '@module-federation/bridge-react';

// Use createBridgeComponent to wrap App as a remote module and export it
export default createBridgeComponent({
  rootComponent: App
});
```

### Step 2: Configure `exposes` Export

Next, you need to configure Module Federation in your build tool to expose the created export file for other applications to use.

:::tip Build Tool Support
The following example uses Rsbuild configuration. Please adjust according to your build tool:
- **Rsbuild**: `@module-federation/rsbuild-plugin`
- **Rspack**: `@module-federation/enhanced/rspack`
- **Webpack**: `@module-federation/enhanced/webpack`
- **Vite**: `@module-federation/vite`

:::

```ts
// rsbuild.config.ts
import { pluginModuleFederation } from '@module-federation/rsbuild-plugin';

export default {
  plugins: [
    pluginModuleFederation({
      name: 'remote1',
      exposes: {
        './export-app': './src/export-app.tsx', // Export application-type remote module
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```

## Bridge Router Configuration

React Bridge provides powerful routing coordination capabilities that can dynamically inject basename and routing context based on the current path.

:::info Routing Framework Support
Bridge Router currently supports routing proxy functionality for React Router v5, v6, and v7 versions. Other routing frameworks like `@tanstack/react-router` are not currently supported.
:::

### Enable Bridge Router

```ts
// rsbuild.config.ts
import { pluginModuleFederation } from '@module-federation/rsbuild-plugin';

export default {
  plugins: [
    pluginModuleFederation({
      name: 'remote1',
      exposes: {
        './export-app': './src/export-app.tsx',
      },
      bridge: {
        // Enable Bridge Router routing capability
        enableBridgeRouter: true, // Default is true
      }
    }),
  ],
};
```

### Configuration Description

- **`enableBridgeRouter: true`** (Recommended) - Automatically handle basename and routing coordination, but cannot set `react-router-dom` as shared
- **`enableBridgeRouter: false`** - Can set `react-router-dom` as shared, but requires manual routing integration

:::warning Important
When Bridge Router is enabled, do not configure `react-router-dom` as a shared dependency, otherwise it will cause routing functionality issues.
