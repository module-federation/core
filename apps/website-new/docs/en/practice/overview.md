# Overview

Module Federation, as a module sharing solution, aims to solve code reuse issues, optimize the build process, and enhance runtime performance. However, in practical project development, these functionalities alone are insufficient. It often needs to be combined with various frameworks to understand how to use Module Federation under different frameworks and how to integrate multiple functionalities from different frameworks. Additionally, it is necessary to consider the differing needs of various application scenarios, such as backend applications versus mobile application development scenarios.
This "Practical Guide" aims to address the above issues by providing a series of best practices for using Module Federation. The main content includes two parts:

1. Bridge: For common business development scenarios: how to load application-level modules (with routing) and how to load modules across different frontend frameworks.
2. Framework: Introduces the usage of Module Federation in different frameworks.
