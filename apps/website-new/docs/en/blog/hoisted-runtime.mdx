# Hoisted Runtime

> Sep 5, 2024

Weâ€™re excited to announce a new experimental feature: `experiments.federationRuntime = 'hoisted'`.

This release introduces **runtime hoisting**, unlocking several powerful capabilities for Module Federation.


## ðŸš€ Key Features

### No More Dynamic Imports!

With runtime hoisting enabled, **dynamic imports (`import()`) at the top of your app are no longer required**. All entrypoints will now initialize asynchronously by default. This means:
- No more eager errors.
- No need for "async boundaries" in userland code.

:::tip
**Note:** Asynchronous entrypoints will always export a promise. This is particularly relevant if you're manually requiring a bundled entrypoint or exposing something like a UMD library to the global scope.

#### Before & After Comparison

See how the new hoisting behavior simplifies entrypoints. Click on the "Before" and "After" tabs to see the difference.

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="Before">
    ```jsx
    // entrypoint
    import('./bootstrap.js')

    // bootstrap.js
    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
    import App from './App';

    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!);
    root.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
      <App />
    </React.StrictMode>,
    );
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="After">
    ```jsx
    // entrypoint
    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
    import App from './App';

    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!);
    root.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
      <App />
    </React.StrictMode>,
    );
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


### Support for `runtimeChunk: single`

In the past, using **single runtime chunks** could lead to problems with Module Federation, as federation code and remote modules were bundled in the entrypoint instead of the runtime.

With **hoisted runtime**, all necessary modules are moved into the runtime chunks, eliminating these issues and making Federation work smoothly with single runtime chunks. This also resolves long-standing issues from Module Federation V1.


### Performance Improvements

While we plan to focus on further **bundle size optimization** in future updates, this is a solid first step.

- **Duplicate code removal**: Hoisting removes redundant code in entrypoints that resulted from injecting the runtime into the entrypoints instead of the runtime chunk.
- **Size reduction**: For projects using `runtimeChunk: single`, you can expect a reduction of approximately **100 KB** per entrypoint.


### Eager Runtime Access

A more **low-level enhancement** is the immediate initialization of the federation runtime as a **Webpack `RuntimeModule`**.

In the past, federation would start with the userâ€™s entrypoint, leading to issues with chunk loading. Now, federation begins with Webpack's runtime, preventing "chicken and egg" issues with **split chunks**.


### Improved Split Chunks Support

Previously, using `splitChunks: all` could lead to issues with Module Federation. With the new hoisting feature, **split chunk support** is significantly improved, and such issues should no longer arise.


### Preparing for Shareable Runtime

While this feature isnâ€™t included in the current release, hoisting lays the groundwork for a future enhancement: **shareable federation runtimes**. This will allow you to rely on the hostâ€™s copy of `module-federation/runtime`, reducing the payload size of remote entry files.
