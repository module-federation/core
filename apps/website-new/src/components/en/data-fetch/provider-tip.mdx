::: info Note
Producers can use [Rslib](/guide/basic/plugins/rsbuild#ssr) and [Modern.js](/guide/framework/modernjs) to generate components.

However, it's important to note that because the data in "Data Fetching" is injected by the consumer, if a component uses "Data Fetching", its exported non-MF components cannot be isomorphic with the MF components.
