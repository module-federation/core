                Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google
                that tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses the data
                collected to track and monitor the use of our Service. This data
                is shared with other Google services. Google may use the
                collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its
                advertising network.

                You can opt out of having made your activity on the Service
                available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics
                opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents the Google Analytics
                JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) from sharing
                information with Google Analytics about visits activity.
