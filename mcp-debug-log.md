# MCP Host Debug Log

## Session: 2025-06-24

### Tasks:
- [ ] Start MCP host application
- [ ] Verify host is working correctly  
- [ ] Debug any issues found

### Discoveries:
- Host expects ES modules but needs to be built first
- Available npm scripts: `serve:all`, `dev`, `start:host`, `start:remote1`, `start:remote2`
- Host configured for remotes at ports 3030 (remote1) and 3031 (remote2)
- Need to start remotes first, then host

### Test Results:
✅ **Host Build**: Successfully built with `npx nx build mcp-host`
✅ **Host Startup**: Host runs successfully and attempts to connect to remotes
❌ **Remote Connection**: Cannot connect to remotes at localhost:3030 and localhost:3031
- Error: Cannot find module 'mcp_remote1@http://localhost:3030/remoteEntry.js'
- Error: Cannot find module 'mcp_remote2@http://localhost:3031/remoteEntry.js'

### Status:
- **Host is working correctly** - it starts up and shows federation configuration
- **Federation setup is correct** - detects 2 remotes at expected ports
- **Need to start remotes** - remotes are not running (expected since user mentioned they are already running them)

### Root Cause:
**Module Federation requires HTTP servers** - the remotes need to be served as HTTP endpoints:
- Remote1 should serve `remoteEntry.js` at `http://localhost:3030/`
- Remote2 should serve `remoteEntry.js` at `http://localhost:3031/`

### Next Steps:
1. Start remote1: `npx nx serve mcp-remote1` (should run on port 3030)
2. Start remote2: `npx nx serve mcp-remote2` (should run on port 3031)  
3. Then start host: `node apps/mcp/host/dist/main.js`
