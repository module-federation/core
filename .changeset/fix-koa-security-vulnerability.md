fix(dts-plugin): update koa to 2.16.2 to fix CVE-2025-8129

Security fix for open redirect vulnerability (GHSA-jgmv-j7ww-jx2x) in koa dependency.
Updates koa from 2.16.1 to 2.16.2 to prevent attackers from manipulating the Referrer 
header in koa's back redirect functionality. Version 2.16.2 restricts redirects to 
same-origin only, preventing malicious external redirects.
