Stabilize the Next.js v9 integration path with improved Next.js 16/RSC behavior, hydration handling, and E2E coverage.

This also aligns supporting runtime/build plumbing across Node runtime helpers, enhanced runtime/container hooks, manifest generation, Modern.js integrations, and SDK webpack-path normalization used by these flows.
