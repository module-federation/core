### 3. Fallback Props and Error Information
- ✅ Fallback components receive correct error props
- ✅ Error information includes id, lifecycle, from, error details
- ✅ Custom props can be passed to fallback components
- ✅ Error details are preserved across different lifecycle stages

### 4. Recovery Mechanisms
- ✅ Retry logic with exponential backoff
- ✅ Circuit breaker with automatic recovery after timeout
- ✅ Health check mechanisms for smart recovery
- ✅ Progressive recovery with increasing delays
- ✅ Recovery works when remotes come back online

### 5. Production-Ready Examples

## Running the Tests

### Individual Test Files
```bash
# Test fallback component rendering
pnpm test packages/runtime-core/__tests__/fallback-component-rendering.spec.ts

# Test ErrorBoundary integration
pnpm test packages/utilities/__tests__/ErrorBoundary-integration.spec.tsx

# Test fallback props and recovery
pnpm test packages/runtime-core/__tests__/fallback-props-recovery.spec.ts

# Test production examples verification
pnpm test packages/runtime-core/__tests__/production-examples-verification.spec.ts
```

### All Fallback Tests
```bash
# Run all fallback-related tests
pnpm test --testNamePattern="fallback|ErrorBoundary|recovery|production.*examples"
```

## Integration with Existing Test Suite

These tests integrate with the existing Module Federation test suite:

1. **Mock Infrastructure**: Uses existing mock server and utilities from `packages/runtime-core/__tests__/mock/`
2. **Test Setup**: Follows existing patterns with `beforeEach`/`afterEach` cleanup
3. **Assertions**: Uses consistent assertion patterns with existing tests
4. **Coverage**: Complements existing `errorLoadRemote-lifecycle.spec.ts` tests

## Validation Results

### ✅ Documentation Accuracy Verified
- All documented examples work exactly as described
- Plugin configurations match documentation specifications
- Error handling patterns are correctly implemented

### ✅ Production Readiness Confirmed
- Circuit breaker patterns prevent cascade failures
- Recovery mechanisms work reliably
- Error information is properly passed to fallback components
- Performance considerations (caching, debouncing) are handled

### ✅ Integration Testing Complete
- ErrorBoundary works with Module Federation components
- FederationBoundary handles dynamic imports correctly
- Suspense integration functions as expected
- Router integration patterns are validated

## Recommendations for Production Use

Based on test results, the following patterns are recommended for production:

1. **Use Enhanced Offline Fallback Plugin** from `building-custom-retry-plugin.mdx`
   - Includes circuit breaker, retry logic, and comprehensive error handling
   - Configurable timeouts and retry attempts
   - Automatic recovery mechanisms

2. **Implement ErrorBoundary with Reset Functionality**
   - Allow users to recover from errors without page refresh
   - Include error logging for monitoring
   - Style fallbacks appropriately for your application

3. **Configure Appropriate Retry Strategies**
   - Use exponential backoff for network errors
   - Implement circuit breakers for high-traffic applications
   - Include health checks for smart recovery

4. **Provide Meaningful Fallback Components**
   - Include error details in development mode
   - Show user-friendly messages in production
   - Provide retry buttons where appropriate

## Next Steps

1. **Integration with CI/CD**: Add these tests to the continuous integration pipeline
2. **Performance Testing**: Add performance tests for fallback scenarios
3. **E2E Testing**: Create end-to-end tests using the router-demo application
4. **Documentation Updates**: Update documentation with any findings from testing

This comprehensive test suite ensures that fallback component rendering functionality works reliably across all documented scenarios and provides a solid foundation for production Module Federation applications.
