# Module Federation 2.0

Module Federation 2.0 is used to distinguish it from Module Federation (1.0) in Webpack. In Module Federation 2.0, the relationship between runtime and build tools is redesigned, and Manifest files are introduced. Compared with 1.0, Module Federation 2.0 introduces more major new features.

## 💡 What is Module Federation?

- Module Federation is a concept that allows developers to share code and resources across multiple JavaScript applications
