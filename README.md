# Module Federation

`Module Federation 2.0` differs from the `Module Federation` built into `Webpack5` by providing not only the core features of module export, loading, and dependency sharing but also additional dynamic type hinting, `Manifest`, `Federation Runtime`, and `Runtime Plugin System`. These features make `Module Federation` more suitable for use as a micro-frontend architecture in large-scale `Web` applications.

## 💡 What is Module Federation?

- Module Federation is a concept that allows developers to share code and resources across multiple JavaScript applications

- Module Federation can be used to split monolithic applications into micro-front-end architectures

- Module Federation reuses common dependencies between modules as much as possible
