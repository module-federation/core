   import federation from '@module-federation/webpack-bundler-runtime';
   // Initialize federation global scope
   if(!__webpack_require__.federation.instance){
     __webpack_require__.federation.instance =
       __webpack_require__.federation.runtime.init(initOptions);
     // Connect share scope
     __webpack_require__.federation.attachShareScopeMap(__webpack_require__);
     // Install initial shares
     __webpack_require__.federation.installInitialConsumes();
   }
   ```

2. Share Scope Initialization Flow:
   * FederationRuntimePlugin generates entry
   * Entry imports webpack-bundler-runtime
   * Runtime init creates FederationHost instance
   * Share system initialization sequence:
     1. formatShareConfigs processes share options
     2. initShareScopeMap sets up scope structure
     3. attachShareScopeMap connects to webpack
     4. registerShared populates share scopes

3. Container and Share Integration:
   * Container Entry Setup:
     - Initializes federation instance
     - Sets up share scope maps
     - Configures layer support
     - Connects remote containers
   * Share Resolution Process:
     1. Container requests shared module

     3. Version compatibility verified
     4. Module loaded and cached
     5. Share scope updated

4. Layer-Aware Share Management:
   * Layer Detection:
     - Plugin reads layer configuration

     - Falls back to default scope
     - Handles cross-layer dependencies
     - Maintains version compatibility

5. Runtime Share Loading Sequence:
   a. Eager Loading:
      * Plugin identifies eager shares
      * installInitialConsumes loads them
      * Shares cached in scope map
      * Version conflicts resolved

   b. On-Demand Loading:
      * Container requests share
      * loadShare checks existing shares
      * Version compatibility verified

16. Share Scope and Layer System Deep Dive (Updated from Runtime Tests)

A. Share Resolution Flow (From Test Logs)
1. Initial Configuration Resolution:
   ```typescript
   // Initial config processing
   {
     request: 'layered-react',
     resolveRequest: 'react',
     shareKey: 'react',
     layer: 'react-layer',
     issuerLayer: 'react-layer'
   }
   ```

2. Layer Scope Creation:
   * Creates multiple scope levels:
     ```typescript
     shareScopes: [
       'default',
       '(react-layer)default',
       '(react-layer)(react-layer)default'
     ]
     ```
   * Scope naming pattern: `(layerName)scopeName`
   * Nested layers supported via multiple prefixes

B. Share Loading Process (Runtime Flow)
1. Share Registration:
   ```typescript
   shareInfo = {
     deps: [],
     useIn: ['container_7'],
     from: 'container_7',
     version: '1.0.0',
     scope: ['(react-layer)default'],
     shareConfig: {
       singleton: true,
       eager: false,
       layer: 'react-layer'
     }
   }
   ```

2. Share State Management:
   ```typescript
   shareScopeState = {
     "react": {
       "1.0.0": {
         "deps": [],
         "useIn": ["container_7"],
         "from": "container_7",
         "version": "1.0.0",
         "scope": ["default"],
         "shareConfig": {
           "singleton": true,
           "eager": false,
           "layer": null
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

C. Layer Resolution Strategy
1. Resolution Order:
   * Check layer-specific scope first
   * Fall back to default scope if needed
   * Handle cross-layer dependencies
   * Manage singleton shares across layers

2. Version Management:
   * Per-layer version tracking
   * Singleton version resolution
   * Version compatibility checks
   * Strategy inheritance

D. Runtime Integration Points
1. Container Initialization:
   ```typescript
   // Container entry initialization
   {
     name: 'default',
     hasShareScope: true,
     hasInitScope: true,
     availableScopes: ['react']
   }
   ```

2. Share Scope Initialization:
   * Checks for existing scopes
   * Creates new scopes as needed
   * Handles host share scope maps
   * Manages initialization tokens

E. Key Runtime Behaviors (From Tests)

1. Share Resolution:
   ```
   Request Share ->
   Check Layer Config ->
   Check Layer Scope ->
   Check Default Scope ->
   Load Module ->
   Update Share State
   ```

2. Layer Management:
   * Layer isolation maintained
   * Cross-layer sharing supported
   * Singleton shares handled globally
   * Version conflicts resolved

3. Share State Tracking:
   * Per-container tracking
   * Layer-aware caching
   * Version state management
   * Loading state handling

F. Practical Implementation Details

1. Share Loading:
   ```typescript
   // Share loading with layer support
   if (shareConfig?.layer) {
     const layerScope = `(${shareConfig.layer})${scope}`;
     const layerShare = checkScope(layerScope);
     if (layerShare) return layerShare;
   }
   return checkScope(DEFAULT_SCOPE);
   ```

2. Initialization Flow:
   ```typescript
   // Runtime initialization sequence
   federation.initShareScopeMap(name, shareScope, {
     hostShareScopeMap: remoteEntryInitOptions?.shareScopeMap
   });

   // Layer scope initialization
   Object.keys(shareScope).forEach(scope => {
     if (scope.startsWith('(')) {
       federation.initShareScopeMap(scope, { [scope]: shareScope[scope] });
     }
   });
   ```

G. Error Handling and Edge Cases

1. Layer Resolution Fallbacks:
   * Layer not found -> Check default scope
   * Version mismatch -> Check other layers
   * Singleton conflict -> Use highest version

2. Initialization Safeguards:
   * Circular dependency detection
   * Duplicate initialization prevention
   * Token-based scope tracking
   * Version conflict resolution

H. Performance Considerations

1. Share Scope Caching:
   * Layer-specific caching
   * Version state caching
   * Loading state tracking
   * Promise management

2. Optimization Strategies:
   * Eager loading support
   * Layer-aware prefetching
   * Singleton optimization
   * Version deduplication

This deep dive reflects the actual runtime behavior observed in tests, showing how:
1. Layer scopes are created and managed
2. Share resolution handles layers
3. Version management works across layers
4. Initialization flow handles complex scenarios
5. Error cases are properly handled
6. Performance is optimized for different scenarios

Test Analysis for layer-8-full:

1. Share Resolution Flow:
- Test tries to load App with React and remote components
- Share resolution starts in default scope
- Layered share resolution is attempted for react-layer
- Share info shows React version 1.0.0 being loaded from container_7

2. Component Loading:
- ComponentA is loaded from containerA
- App is loaded from containerA
- Both components are trying to access React

3. Version Mismatch:
Expected output:
```
App rendered with React version: 1.0.0
    Non-layered remote component: ComponentA (Regular React: 1.0.0)
    Layered remote component: App rendered with React version: 1.0.0
```

Actual output:
```
App rendered with React version: undefined
    Non-layered remote component: ComponentA rendered with React version: [This is react 0.1.2] with layer This is layered react from react-layer
    Layered remote component: App rendered with [This is react 0.1.2] with layered value: [No Layer] and ComponentA rendered with React version: [This is react 0.1.2] with layer This is layered react from react-layer
```

4. Issues Identified:
- React version is undefined in the main App
- ComponentA is getting React 0.1.2 from react-layer instead of 1.0.0
- Layer information is being mixed between layered and non-layered contexts
- The share resolution might be preferring layered versions when it shouldn't

5. Share Resolution Logs:
- Share scope includes: default, (react-layer)default, (react-layer)(react-layer)default
- Initial share state shows React 1.0.0 in default scope
- Layer resolution is happening but might be picking wrong versions

6. Potential Problems:
- Share resolution might not be correctly handling layer boundaries
- Version resolution strategy might need adjustment
- Singleton behavior across layers needs verification
- Layer inheritance rules might need clarification

7. Debug Focus Areas:
- Check share resolution order between layers
- Verify singleton behavior across layer boundaries
- Examine how layer context is passed to components
- Review version resolution strategy in layered contexts
